How many studies are in cBioPortal?,5,"The output correctly states that there are 492 studies in cBioPortal, which matches the expected answer exactly.",5,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of studies and explaining where this information comes from (the cancer_study table).,4,"The answer is mostly concise but includes some additional formatting and explanation about the cancer_study table that, while informative, is not strictly necessary to answer the basic question.",5,"The answer is based entirely on the cBioPortal database as specified in the context, with the SQL query showing direct access to the cancer_study table. No external information or hallucinations are present."
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,5,"The LLM output provides exactly the correct numbers: 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which match the expected answer perfectly.",5,"The output fully addresses the question by providing both patient and sample counts for the MSK-CHORD study, along with additional context about the study methodology.",3,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the output includes excessive formatting, headers, and explanatory text that, while informative, makes it less concise than necessary for a straightforward statistical question.",4,"The numerical data appears to be derived from the database queries shown, but the output includes additional details about the study methodology (targeted sequencing via MSK-IMPACT, clinical annotations) that may not be directly traceable to the provided context, though this information appears reasonable for a study description."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,0,"The LLM output states there are 25,040 primary samples, but the expected answer is 15,928 primary samples. This is a significant factual error.",5,The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific count of primary samples and additional context about the study.,3,"The answer provides the core information but includes unnecessary elaboration such as restating the study name, identifier, and redundant explanations about sample types that don't add value to answering the specific question.",5,"The answer appears to be based on SQL queries executed against the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The LLM shows the actual queries used to derive the answer, demonstrating reliance on the provided source."
What is treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,5,"The output correctly identifies Fluorouracil as the most common specific treatment agent (25.33% of patients), which matches the expected answer. The data and percentages appear accurate based on the SQL query results.",5,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying the most common treatment (Fluorouracil) and provides comprehensive context including treatment categories, specific agents, and key findings. It goes beyond the basic question to provide valuable additional insights.",3,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the response includes extensive additional details about treatment categories, percentages, and background context that, while informative, make it quite verbose for a straightforward question about the most common treatment.",5,"The answer appears to be entirely based on the database queries executed, as evidenced by the specific percentages and patient counts that correspond to the SQL query results. No external knowledge or hallucinations are apparent."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,3,"The gene rankings are correct (TP53, TTN/MUC16 tied, ATRX, DNAH9), but the mutation frequencies are significantly different from the expected answer. For example, TP53 shows 20.5% vs expected 22.4%, and other genes also show lower percentages than expected.",5,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing all 5 most frequently mutated genes with their frequencies, rankings, and additional context about sample sizes and gene functions.",3,"The answer provides extensive additional information including detailed tables, key observations, and biological context that, while informative, makes it less concise than necessary for the specific question asked.",5,"The answer appears to be based entirely on database queries from cbioportal as specified in the context. The SQL queries shown demonstrate direct database access to the TARGET osteosarcoma study data, with no apparent external knowledge added."
What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?,5,"The LLM output provides the exact correct answer of 11.62%, matching the expected answer perfectly. The calculation (125 out of 1,076 patients) is mathematically accurate.",5,"The output fully addresses the question by providing the requested fraction, supporting data (125 out of 1,076 patients), and additional context including detailed age distribution breakdowns and relevant statistics.",3,"While the core answer is clearly stated, the output includes extensive additional information such as detailed age distribution breakdowns, epidemiological context, and additional statistics that, while relevant, go beyond what was specifically asked for.",5,"The answer is entirely based on data retrieved from the cbioportal database as evidenced by the SQL queries shown. The epidemiological statement about neuroblastoma affecting young children is supported by the actual data presented (88.4% being 5 years or younger), making it a data-driven conclusion rather than external knowledge."
What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?,5,"The output correctly identifies R175H as the most frequent TP53 mutation with 5.95% frequency, which exactly matches the expected answer.",5,The answer fully addresses the question by identifying the specific mutation (R175H) and its frequency (5.95%). It also provides additional valuable context including the top 5 mutations and mutation type distribution.,3,"While the core answer is clear and prominently displayed, the output includes extensive additional information (top 5 mutations, mutation type distribution, biological explanation) that, while valuable, makes it quite lengthy for such a specific question.",4,"The statistical data and specific mutations appear to be derived from database queries. However, the biological explanation about R175H being a hotspot mutation in the DNA-binding domain and its functional consequences appears to draw on external knowledge not directly provided by the cbioportal database queries shown."
How many patients have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study?,4,"The LLM output states 28 patients (5.5%) have EGFR amplification, while the expected answer is 26 patients (4.6%). The difference is small but notable - there's a 2-patient discrepancy and a 0.9% difference in prevalence.",5,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the number of patients, percentage, and additional context about the study. It includes relevant details about copy number alterations and clinical significance.",3,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the output includes extensive additional details about copy number values, clinical context, and literature comparisons that, while informative, make it less concise than necessary for the specific question asked.",4,"The output is mostly based on database queries shown in the SQL section, but includes some external knowledge about EGFR amplifications being 'less common than EGFR mutations' and patients potentially benefiting from 'EGFR-targeted therapies,' which appears to come from outside the provided context."
Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?,5,"The output correctly identifies the most common KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer. The top mutations listed (G12D, G12V, G13D, G12C, G12S, G12A) match the expected answer, with accurate frequencies and percentages based on the cBioPortal database analysis.",5,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying all the most common KRAS mutations mentioned in the expected answer (G12D, G12V, G12C, G12A, G12S, G13D) and provides additional context with frequencies, percentages, and codon groupings that enhance understanding.",3,"While the core information is present, the output includes extensive additional details like codon groupings, percentages, and detailed analysis that, while valuable, make it somewhat verbose for a straightforward question about which mutations are most common.",5,"The output is entirely based on the cBioPortal database analysis as specified in the context. All statistics, mutation frequencies, and patient counts are derived from the SQL queries executed against the database, with no external information or hallucinations present."
What is the median survival time in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,5,"The LLM output correctly identifies the median survival time as 21.0 months, which matches very closely with the expected answer of approximately 22 months. This minor difference is likely due to different data subsets or analysis methods, but the result is essentially accurate.",5,"The output fully addresses the question by providing the median survival time and goes beyond by including comprehensive details about the study, patient demographics, survival statistics, and important contextual information about the analysis.",2,"While the core answer is clearly stated, the output is quite verbose with extensive additional details about study demographics, patient status, and contextual notes that, while informative, go well beyond what was asked in the simple question about median survival time.",5,"The output appears to be entirely based on data retrieved from the cbioportal database as evidenced by the comprehensive SQL queries shown. All information provided can be traced back to the database queries executed, with no apparent external knowledge or hallucinations."
How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?,5,The LLM output correctly states that MGMT promoter methylation leads to better prognosis and improved treatment response to temozolomide. The key finding that methylated patients show better survival outcomes and greater benefit from TMZ therapy is accurate and aligns with established medical knowledge.,5,"The output comprehensively addresses both aspects of the question - prognosis (survival outcomes) and treatment response (differential response to temozolomide). It provides detailed survival statistics, treatment comparisons, molecular correlations, demographics, and clinical significance.",2,"While the information is valuable, the output is excessively detailed with extensive statistics, multiple subsections, and demographic information that goes beyond what's necessary to answer the core question. The key point could be communicated much more succinctly.",5,"The entire output is based on data retrieved from the cBioPortal database as evidenced by the extensive SQL queries shown. All statistics, survival data, and molecular correlations are derived from the database queries, with no external knowledge or hallucinations present."
For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies that cBioPortal lacks quality of life and secondary cancer data, but provides extensive technical details about EML4-ALK fusion variants and survival data that go beyond what can be verified from the database queries shown. The expected answer is simply that this question cannot be answered with the cBioPortal database.",5,"The output fully addresses why the question cannot be answered with cBioPortal, explaining the limitations regarding quality of life and secondary cancer data, and suggests alternative data sources needed.",1,"The output is extremely verbose and includes extensive technical details about fusion variants, patient counts, and survival data when the simple answer should be that the question cannot be answered with this database. The expected answer is much more concise.",3,"While the LLM correctly identifies the database limitations, it provides very detailed information about specific patient counts (334 patients, 298 with OS data, etc.) and fusion variant classifications that appear to go beyond what the SQL queries clearly demonstrate. Some of this detailed analysis may not be fully supported by the query results shown."
For the TCGA pan-cancer cohort what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?,2,"The LLM output contains several significant inaccuracies compared to the expected answer. Most critically, it reports the survival difference as not statistically significant (p ≈ 0.108) while the expected answer shows statistical significance (p = 0.0209). The survival values are also incorrect - the LLM reports median survival of 21.16 months for KRAS-only vs 19.33 months for both mutations, while the expected answer shows ~22 months for both mutations and that KRAS-only median was not reached.",5,"The output fully addresses all aspects of the question by providing survival differences, statistical significance testing, patient counts, and detailed statistical analysis including confidence intervals and test statistics.",2,"The output is excessively verbose with unnecessary details such as detailed breakdowns by cancer types, extensive statistical parameters, and lengthy interpretations that could be much more concise while still being complete.",3,"The LLM appears to have performed its own database analysis using SQL queries rather than relying on the expected answer from cbioportal database. While it uses the same data source (TCGA), it derives different conclusions through its own analysis, which shows some faithfulness to the source but contradicts the provided expected answer."
Does Tylenol cause cancer?,5,The LLM correctly identifies that this question cannot be answered using the cBioPortal database and accurately describes what the database contains (cancer genomics data from clinical studies).,5,"The answer completely addresses the user's question by clearly stating it cannot be answered with the available database, explaining why, and providing appropriate alternative resources for such medical questions.",3,"While the core message is clear, the response includes somewhat verbose explanations about alternative resources and additional offers to help with genomics data that, while helpful, make it less concise than necessary.",5,The response stays completely faithful to the context by acknowledging the limitations of the cBioPortal database and not attempting to answer the medical question with outside knowledge or speculation.
Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,2,"While the LLM correctly identifies that some studies use capture-based methods and provides accurate study identifiers from cBioPortal, it fundamentally misses the expected answer that library preparation protocols are not contained in the database and should be consulted in publications. The technical details about RNA-seq methods are accurate but not verifiable from the cBioPortal database alone.",1,"The LLM provides extensive information about specific studies and methods but fails to address the core limitation that cBioPortal does not contain library preparation protocol information. It does not mention that users should consult the underlying publications for this information, which is the key point of the expected answer.",1,"The output is extremely verbose and detailed, providing far more information than necessary. It includes extensive lists of studies, technical explanations about RNA-seq methods, and detailed recommendations when a simple statement about database limitations would suffice.",2,"While the study identifiers and some basic information appear to come from the database queries, the LLM makes many assumptions about library preparation methods and RNA-seq protocols that cannot be verified from the cBioPortal database alone. It provides detailed technical information about capture-based methods and polyA enrichment that goes beyond what can be determined from the database schema and query results shown."
In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?,0,"The LLM output provides completely incorrect gene names. The expected answer lists AGR3, TFF1, SRARP, CYP2B7P, and CPB1 as the top 5 down-regulated genes, but the LLM output lists FGF4, CCDC172, PRM1, PSG11, and ADAM5. None of the genes match between the expected and actual answers.",5,"The output fully addresses the question by providing exactly 5 down-regulated genes with detailed expression statistics, sample counts, and additional context about the study parameters.",2,"While the core answer is present, the output includes excessive detail such as exact expression values, Entrez Gene IDs, detailed study parameters, and lengthy biological interpretations that go beyond what was requested for a simple list of top 5 genes.",5,"The output appears to be based entirely on database queries executed against the cbioportal database as specified in the context. All information is traceable to the SQL queries and database results, with no apparent external knowledge or hallucinations."
