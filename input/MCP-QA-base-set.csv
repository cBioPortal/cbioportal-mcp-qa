3,How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,Clinical Data,15928 primary samples,3.md
4,What is treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,Treatment,Fluorouracil,4.md
5,What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,Genomic Alteration Frequencies,TP53 22.4%; MUC16 11.2%; TTN 11.2%; ATRX 7.7%; DNAH9 7.0%,5.md
6,What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?,Cohort Statistics,11.62%,6.md
7,What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?,Genomic Alteration Frequencies,R175H in 5.95% of samples,7.md
8,How many patients have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study?,Genomic Alteration Frequencies,26 patients (4.6%) have an amplification in the EGFR gene,8.md
9,Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?,Genomic Alteration Frequencies,G12D; G12V; G12C; G12A; G12S; G13D,9.md
10,What is the median survival time in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,Survival Analysis,Approximately 22 months,10.md
11,How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?,Treatment,When the MGMT promoter is methylated cancer cells are vulnerable to temozolomide leading to a better prognosis,11.md
12,For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,Out of scope,This question cannot be answered with the cBioPortal databse,12.md
13,For the TCGA pan-cancer cohort what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?,Survival Analysis - Gene Alteration,Patients with both TP53 and KRAS mutations had a median overall survival of approximately 22 months. While patients with only a KRAS mutation had a median overall survival that was not reached as none of them had died by the end of the study period. The log-rank test p-value is 0.0209 which indicates that the difference in overall survival between the two groups is statistically significant.,13.md
14,Does Tylenol cause cancer?,Out of scope,This question cannot be answered with the cBioPortal databse,14.md
15,Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,Out of scope,Library preparation protocols are not contained in the database and should be consulted in the publications underlying the studies.,15.md
16,In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?,Expression comparison,AGR3; TFF1; SRARP; CYP2B7P; CPB1,16.md
