10,What is the median survival time in the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?,Survival Analysis,The median survival time in the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET is not available. The Kaplan–Meier curve does not fall below 50% so the median overall survival cannot be estimated.,10.md
11,How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?,Treatment,"""MGMT promoter methylation is associated with improved overall survival across multiple treatment contexts in glioblastoma according to the Glioblastoma (TCGA, Cell 2013) study. Patients with methylated tumors receiving standard radiation show a median survival of 17.6 months (95% CI 7.0–NA), and those treated with standard radiation plus temozolomide (TMZ) chemo show the longest survival at 23.5 months (22.2–47.9). Methylated tumors treated with TMZ chemoradiation plus TMZ achieve a median survival of 17.8 months (15.7–21.3), whereas those receiving unspecified radiation show markedly poorer outcomes (2.2 months, 1.4–3.9). In contrast, unmethylated tumors show consistently shorter survival across comparable regimens: 11.6 months (10.3–NA) with standard radiation, 12.7 months (11.7–19.3) with standard radiation plus TMZ, 14.5 months (12.9–15.9) with TMZ chemoradiation plus TMZ, and 2.7 months (1.2–5.4) with unspecified radiation. Across all groups, survival curves for methylated tumors cluster at higher survival times, indicating that MGMT promoter methylation confers both a prognostic advantage and increased benefit from TMZ-containing therapy.""",11.md
12,For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,Out of scope,This question cannot be answered with the cBioPortal databse,12.md
13,In the “Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes” study what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?,Survival Analysis - Gene Alteration,Patients with both TP53 and KRAS mutations had a median overall survival of approximately 22 months. While patients with only a KRAS mutation had a median overall survival that was not reached as none of them had died by the end of the study period. The log-rank test p-value is 0.0209 which indicates that the difference in overall survival between the two groups is statistically significant.,13.md

15,Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,Out of scope,Library preparation protocols are not contained in the database and should be consulted in the publications underlying the studies.,15.md
16,In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?,Expression comparison,AGR3; TFF1; SRARP; CYP2B7P; CPB1,16.md
17,In the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients who were older than four when diagnosed and the younger ones?,Survival Analysis,Older patients (>4) had significantly worse overall survival compared to younger patients (≤4) with a higher hazard of death (HR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.17–1.86; log-rank p = 3.37×10⁻⁴). Their median overall survival was 79.0 months (95% CI 53–122) whereas median survival was not reached in the ≤4 group.,17.md
18,In the TCGA Glioblastoma multiforme study compare the median patient age at diagnosis between patients with IDH1 R132H mutation and patients with wild-type IDH1.,Mutation-Associated Clinical Differences,"""Patients with IDH1 R132H mutations are diagnosed at a substantially younger age (median ~40 years) compared with IDH1 wild-type patients (median ~60 years; Wilcoxon p = 3.9 × 10⁻⁸) according to the Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) study.""",18.md
19,How does PTEN alteration (mutations or homozygous deletions) affect pAKT protein levels in lung squamous cell carcinoma?,Protein levels,"""PTEN mutations or homozygous deletions are associated with significantly increased pAKT protein levels in LUSC (e.g., AKT1_pT308: 0.83 vs 0.17; log2 ratio = 0.66; p = 2.6 × 10⁻⁸) according to the Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) study.""",19.md
20,What percentage of endometrial cancer samples have hypermutation (>5000 mutations) and how does this correlate with histological subtype?,Hypermutation Phenotype,"""According to the Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) study,  approximately 7–8% of endometrial cancer samples are hypermutated (>5000 mutations). These hypermutated tumors show strong enrichment for the POLE subtype and, to a lesser extent, MSI tumors, whereas non-hypermutated tumors are primarily CN-high or CN-low.""",20.md
21,How does the mutation landscape differ between primary and metastatic samples from the MSK-CHORD Study?,Genomic Alteration Comparison,"""The mutation landscape differs between primary and metastatic samples through modest but highly significant enrichment of specific alterations (1.5-3x fold-changes). Metastases show enrichment for genes involved in epigenetic regulation (H3C14, H3C13, H3-3A), hormone signaling (ESR1, AR), metabolism (MTAP), and cell cycle control (CDKN2B, DUSP4), while losing alterations in immune recognition (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and apoptosis pathways (CASP8).""",21.md
22,What percentage of endometrial cancer patients have co-occurring oncogenic mutations in both KRAS and NRAS?,Co-occurring Mutations,"""When restricting the analysis to driver mutations (as defined by OncoKB and hotspot annotations), co-occurring KRAS and NRAS driver mutations are extremely rare in endometrial cancer. Only 2 of 511 evaluable patients (0.39%) harbor both mutations. The mutual exclusivity test shows no statistically significant association between KRAS and NRAS driver alterations (p = 0.691), indicating no evidence for preferential co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity in this cohort.""",22.md
23,What is the correlation between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels in ovarian cancer samples?,Protein Expression Correlation,"""In ovarian cancer samples from the Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) study, EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels show a moderate positive correlation. The Spearman correlation is 0.45 (p = 2.96 × 10⁻¹³) and the Pearson correlation is 0.51 (p = 6.94 × 10⁻¹⁷), indicating that higher EGFR mRNA levels are generally associated with higher EGFR protein abundance.""",23.md
24,Which cancer types have the highest frequency of EGFR mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?,Cross-Cancer Mutation Frequency,"""Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, glioblastoma shows the highest frequency of EGFR mutations (~15%). Elevated mutation rates are also observed in non–small cell lung cancer, melanoma, glioma, and endometrial cancer, each in the 5–10% range. Additional tumor types with moderately increased EGFR mutation frequencies (~2–5%) include esophagogastric cancer, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, and adenocortical carcinoma.""",24.md
25,What is the correlation between tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability status in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?,Clinical Data Correlation Analysis,"""Tumor mutational burden (TMB) demonstrates a significant positive association with microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD cohort. Using continuous MSI scores, TMB correlates moderately with MSI, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.37 (p = 1.18 × 10⁻¹⁷⁵) and a Pearson coefficient of 0.58 (p = 0.00), indicating that higher MSI scores correspond to higher mutational burden. Consistent with these quantitative correlations, categorical MSI typing shows a clear separation wherein MSI-instable tumors exhibit high TMB, MSI-stable tumors show uniformly low TMB, and indeterminate cases fall between these groups.""",25.md
26,What percentage of colorectal cancer samples have KRAS mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study?,Genomic Alteration Frequencies,"""In the MSK-CHORD (MSK Nature 2024) cohort, KRAS is mutated in 2,355 of 5,543 colorectal cancer samples, corresponding to a mutation frequency of 42.5%.""",26.md
27,Which cancer types have the highest aneuploidy scores and how does this correlate with mutation burden across TCGA Pan-Cancer studies?,Aneuploidy Analysis,"""Across TCGA Pan-Cancer studies, tumors with the highest aneuploidy burdens included seminoma, non-seminomatous germ cell tumor, adrenocortical carcinoma, non–small cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer, all of which displayed elevated median aneuploidy scores. Although bladder cancer and non–small cell lung cancer also ranked among the tumor types with the highest mutational burdens, seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors showed some of the lowest TMB values, with adrenocortical carcinoma exhibiting intermediate levels. These patterns indicate that aneuploidy does not reliably coincide with high mutation loads across tumor types.""",27.md
28,Which cancer types show the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?,Pan-Cancer BRAF Analysis,"""Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, thyroid carcinoma exhibits by far the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations, affecting 56.7% of cases. Melanoma shows the next-highest prevalence, with 35.8% of tumors harboring V600E. Colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma follow at low single-digit frequencies, whereas all remaining cancer types display V600E rates below 1%.""",28.md
29,"""What are the survival differences between EGFR-mutated, EGFR-amplified, and EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients?""",Mutation Subtype Analysis,"“Across patients from the Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) study, EGFR mutations were not associated with a statistically significant difference in overall survival compared with EGFR–wild-type tumors (log-rank p = 0.125). Median overall survival was 42.5 months for EGFR-mutant patients versus 53.3 months for wild-type patients, with an estimated hazard ratio (HR) of 1.38 (95% CI: 0.87–2.18), indicating no clear survival disadvantage. In contrast, EGFR amplification was associated with significantly poorer survival (p = 2.82 × 10⁻³). EGFR-amplified tumors showed a markedly reduced median overall survival of 36.7 months compared with 53.3 months for EGFR–wild-type patients. The hazard ratio for amplified tumors was 2.15 (95% CI: 1.05–4.41), consistent with substantially shorter survival in this subgroup. Overall, EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas do not exhibit significantly different survival outcomes compared with wild-type cases in this cohort, whereas EGFR-amplified tumors show significantly worse survival.”",29.md
30,Is BRCA1 promoter methylation associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer?,Methylation Expression Analysis,"“In the Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) cohort, BRCA1 promoter methylation is clearly associated with reduced BRCA1 mRNA expression. Increasing methylation at the promoter-associated probe (cg04658354) shows a strong inverse correlation with BRCA1 transcript levels (Pearson r = –0.69, Spearman r = –0.43; both p < 1×10⁻¹⁴). These findings indicate that promoter hypermethylation actively corresponds to transcriptional downregulation of BRCA1 in ovarian tumors.”",30.md
