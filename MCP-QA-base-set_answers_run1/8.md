# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** How many patients have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the cBioPortal database, here are the results for EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study:

**28 patients** have EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma (Firehose Legacy) study.

**Additional details:**
- All 28 cases have a copy number alteration value of +2, which represents amplification
- This represents 28 out of 506 total patients in the study (**5.5%** prevalence)
- Each patient has one sample with EGFR amplification (28 patients = 28 samples)

The EGFR amplification frequency of ~5.5% is consistent with known literature for lung adenocarcinoma, where EGFR amplifications are less common than EGFR mutations but still represent an important subset of patients who may benefit from EGFR-targeted therapies.
