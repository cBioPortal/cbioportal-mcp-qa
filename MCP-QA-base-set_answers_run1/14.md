# Question 14

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** Does Tylenol cause cancer?

**Answer:**

I cannot answer questions about whether specific medications like Tylenol cause cancer through this database server. This cBioPortal database contains cancer genomics data from clinical studies and research, but it doesn't include information about medication causality or general medical advice.

For questions about medication safety and cancer risk, you would need to consult:
- Medical literature databases
- Healthcare professionals
- Regulatory agencies like the FDA
- Clinical pharmacology resources

If you have questions about the cancer genomics data available in this cBioPortal database - such as mutation patterns, clinical attributes, patient outcomes, or molecular profiles - I'd be happy to help you explore that information.
