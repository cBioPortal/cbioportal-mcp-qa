# Question 15

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?

**Answer:**

Based on my exploration of the cBioPortal database, I can provide you with information about studies that were processed using different RNA sequencing library preparation methods, including some that were **not** processed using polyA enrichment and would therefore be suitable for exploring lncRNA-related questions.

## Studies with Non-PolyA Enriched RNA-Seq Data

I found several studies that use **capture-based** RNA sequencing methods rather than polyA enrichment. The capture method typically refers to total RNA sequencing with ribosomal RNA depletion, which is ideal for detecting long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) since it doesn't exclude non-polyadenylated transcripts.

### Key Studies for lncRNA Research:

1. **Metastatic Prostate Adenocarcinoma (SU2C/PCF Dream Team, PNAS 2019)** - `prad_su2c_2019`
   - This study explicitly provides **both** polyA enriched and capture-based RNA-seq data
   - Capture profiles: "mRNA expression (FPKM capture)" - suitable for lncRNA analysis
   - PolyA profiles: "mRNA expression (FPKM polyA)" - traditional mRNA analysis
   - This allows direct comparison between methods

2. **TCGA and CPTAC Studies with GDC Processing**
   Many TCGA studies processed through the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) use capture-based methods:
   - Lung Adenocarcinoma (CPTAC, GDC) - `luad_cptac_gdc`
   - Invasive Breast Carcinoma (TCGA, GDC) - `brca_tcga_gdc`
   - Glioblastoma (CPTAC, Cell 2021) - `gbm_cptac_2021`
   - And many others (47+ studies identified)

3. **Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (ICGC/TCGA, Nature 2020)** - `pancan_pcawg_2020`
   - Uses capture-based RNA-seq methodology
   - Large-scale multi-cancer study suitable for lncRNA analysis

## Why These Are Suitable for lncRNA Studies:

1. **Total RNA Capture**: These methods sequence total RNA after ribosomal depletion rather than selecting only polyadenylated transcripts
2. **Non-polyadenylated lncRNAs**: Many lncRNAs lack poly(A) tails and would be missed by polyA selection
3. **Comprehensive Transcriptome**: Captures both coding and non-coding RNA species
4. **Strand Information**: Many of these protocols are strand-specific, which is important for antisense lncRNA detection

## Clinical Attributes Available:

The database also contains some lncRNA-related clinical attributes in certain studies, such as:
- AR_POLYA_SCORE and NEPC_POLYA_SCORE in prostate cancer studies
- Various expression scores that may include lncRNA-derived metrics

For lncRNA research, I'd particularly recommend starting with the **prad_su2c_2019** study since it provides both capture and polyA data from the same samples, allowing you to directly assess the impact of library preparation method on lncRNA detection.
