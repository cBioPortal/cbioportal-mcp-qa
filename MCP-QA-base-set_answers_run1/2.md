# Question 2

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

## MSK-CHORD Study Patient and Sample Counts

The **MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)** study contains:

- **24,950 patients**
- **25,040 samples**

This study involved targeted sequencing of tumors and their matched normals via MSK-IMPACT, along with clinical annotations. The slight difference between patient and sample counts (90 more samples than patients) indicates that some patients have multiple samples included in the study.
