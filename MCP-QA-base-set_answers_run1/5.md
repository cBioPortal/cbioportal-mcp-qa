# Question 5

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes**:

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Samples with Mutations | Total Mutations | Mutation Frequency |
|------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1    | **TP53**    | 32                     | 33              | 20.5%             |
| 2    | **TTN**     | 16                     | 18              | 10.3%             |
| 3    | **MUC16**   | 16                     | 17              | 10.3%             |
| 4    | **ATRX**    | 11                     | 11              | 7.1%              |
| 5    | **DNAH9**   | 10                     | 10              | 6.4%              |

**Key observations:**

- The study contains **156 total samples** with mutation data
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in 32 samples (20.5%), which is consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor commonly altered in many cancers including osteosarcoma
- **TTN** and **MUC16** are tied for second place, each mutated in 16 samples (10.3%). These are large genes that often appear in mutation frequency lists partly due to their size
- **ATRX** mutations occur in 11 samples (7.1%) - this gene is involved in chromatin remodeling and is known to be altered in various sarcomas
- **DNAH9** rounds out the top 5 with mutations in 10 samples (6.4%)

The mutation frequencies are calculated as the percentage of samples with mutations in each gene relative to the total number of samples in the study.
