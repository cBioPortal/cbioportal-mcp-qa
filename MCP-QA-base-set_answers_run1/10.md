# Question 10

**Type:** Survival Analysis

**Question:** What is the median survival time in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study data, here are the key findings:

## Median Survival Time in TARGET Osteosarcoma Study

**The median survival time is 21.0 months (approximately 1.75 years).**

### Study Details:
- **Study**: Osteosarcoma (TARGET, GDC)
- **Study ID**: os_target_gdc
- **Total patients in study**: 226
- **Patients with survival time data**: 82 patients

### Survival Statistics:
- **Median survival**: 21.0 months
- **Mean survival**: 29.5 months
- **Range**: 2.4 to 130.6 months
- **Minimum survival**: 2.4 months
- **Maximum survival**: 130.6 months

### Patient Status:
- **Deceased**: 80 patients (97.6% of those with survival data)
- **Living**: 2 patients (2.4% of those with survival data)

### Important Notes:
- This analysis is based on 82 patients who had complete survival time data out of 226 total patients in the study
- The vast majority of patients with survival data (97.6%) were deceased at the time of data collection, which allows for a more reliable median survival calculation
- This represents pediatric osteosarcoma cases from the TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) initiative

This median survival time of 21 months reflects the aggressive nature of osteosarcoma, particularly in pediatric populations studied in the TARGET program.
