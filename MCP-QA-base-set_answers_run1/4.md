# Question 4

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What is treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD Study data, here are the most common treatments that patients received:

## Treatment Categories (by % of patients):

1. **Prior Medications to MSK**: 78.36% (19,551 patients)
2. **Chemotherapy**: 68.18% (17,010 patients)  
3. **Radiation Therapy**: 49.37% (12,318 patients)
4. **Hormone Therapy**: 33.58% (8,379 patients)
5. **Targeted Therapy**: 21.55% (5,377 patients)

## Most Common Specific Treatment Agents:

1. **Fluorouracil**: 25.33% (6,319 patients)
2. **Leucovorin**: 22.34% (5,573 patients)
3. **Oxaliplatin**: 22.0% (5,489 patients)
4. **Capecitabine**: 19.27% (4,808 patients)
5. **Carboplatin**: 18.45% (4,604 patients)

## Key Findings:

- **Chemotherapy was the most common active treatment type**, received by over two-thirds (68.18%) of the 24,950 patients in the study
- The most frequently used chemotherapy agents were **fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin** - which are commonly used together in combination regimens like FOLFOX for colorectal cancer
- Nearly half of patients (49.37%) also received **radiation therapy**
- About one-third received **hormone therapy** (33.58%), likely reflecting the significant proportion of hormone-sensitive cancers like breast and prostate cancer in the cohort

The "Prior Medications to MSK" category (78.36%) represents treatments patients received before coming to Memorial Sloan Kettering, indicating that most patients had already received some form of cancer treatment elsewhere before enrollment in this study.
