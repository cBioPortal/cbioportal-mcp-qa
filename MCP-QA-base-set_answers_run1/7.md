# Question 7

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TCGA breast cancer study (PanCancer Atlas 2018), here are the key findings for TP53 mutations:

## Most Frequent TP53 Mutation in TCGA Breast Cancer

**The most frequent specific TP53 mutation is R175H** (p.Arg175His), occurring in **21 cases (5.95%)** of the 353 total TP53 mutations found in this study.

### Top 5 Most Frequent TP53 Mutations:
1. **R175H** (Missense) - 21 cases (5.95%)
2. **R273H** (Missense) - 13 cases (3.68%)
3. **R196*** (Nonsense) - 8 cases (2.27%)
4. **Y220C** (Missense) - 7 cases (1.98%)
5. **R342*** (Nonsense) - 7 cases (1.98%)

### Mutation Type Distribution:
- **Missense mutations**: 216 cases (61.19%) - most common type
- **Frame shift deletions**: 47 cases (13.31%)
- **Nonsense mutations**: 46 cases (13.03%)
- **Splice site mutations**: 24 cases (6.80%)
- **Frame shift insertions**: 14 cases (3.97%)

The R175H mutation is a well-known hotspot mutation in TP53 that occurs in the DNA-binding domain and is commonly found across various cancer types. This missense mutation results in loss of p53 tumor suppressor function, which is critical in cancer development.
