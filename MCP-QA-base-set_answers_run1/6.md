# Question 6

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET (study identifier: nbl_target_2018_pub), I can provide you with the following results:

## Fraction of Patients Older than 5 Years at Diagnosis

**Answer: 11.62%** (125 out of 1,076 patients)

## Detailed Breakdown:

- **Total patients with age data**: 1,076
- **Patients older than 5 years**: 125
- **Fraction older than 5**: 0.116 or **11.62%**

## Age Distribution:
- **0-1 years**: 227 patients (21.1%)
- **1-2 years**: 208 patients (19.3%)
- **2-3 years**: 222 patients (20.6%)
- **3-4 years**: 168 patients (15.6%)
- **4-5 years**: 126 patients (11.7%)
- **5-10 years**: 101 patients (9.4%)
- **10-15 years**: 17 patients (1.6%)
- **>15 years**: 7 patients (0.7%)

## Additional Statistics:
- **Age range**: 0-21 years
- **Average age at diagnosis**: 3.4 years

This data shows that neuroblastoma predominantly affects very young children, with approximately **88.4%** of patients being 5 years old or younger at diagnosis, which is consistent with the known epidemiology of neuroblastoma as a pediatric cancer that typically occurs in early childhood.
