# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** "What are the top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET for mutations, copy numbers and SVs combined?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET. Let me start by checking what studies are available and then query for the genetic alterations.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT cancer_study_identifier, name, description\nFROM cancer_study\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%osteosarcoma%' OR cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%TARGET%' OR name LIKE '%Osteosarcoma%' OR name LIKE '%TARGET%'\n"
}
```

Great! I found the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET: `os_target_gdc`. Now let me query for the top 5 frequently altered genes combining mutations, copy number alterations (CNA), and structural variants (SVs).



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as num_samples_altered,\n    countIf(variant_type = 'mutation') as mutation_count,\n    countIf(variant_type = 'cna') as cna_count,\n    countIf(variant_type = 'structural_variant') as sv_count\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol != ''\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY num_samples_altered DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TP53","num_samples_altered":38,"mutation_count":33,"cna_count":6,"sv_count":0},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"LINC00901","num_samples_altered":32,"mutation_count":0,"cna_count":32,"sv_count":0},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TRIM16","num_samples_altered":31,"mutation_count":1,"cna_count":30,"sv_count":0},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"MYO15A","num_samples_altered":31,"mutation_count":2,"cna_count":30,"sv_count":0},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"RN7SL442P","num_samples_altered":31,"mutation_count":0,"cna_count":31,"sv_count":0}]}
```


Perfect! Here are the **top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET** (combining mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants):

## Top 5 Frequently Altered Genes

| Rank | Gene | Samples Altered | Mutations | Copy Number Alterations | Structural Variants |
|------|------|----------------|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 38 | 33 | 6 | 0 |
| 2 | **LINC00901** | 32 | 0 | 32 | 0 |
| 3 | **TRIM16** | 31 | 1 | 30 | 0 |
| 4 | **MYO15A** | 31 | 2 | 30 | 0 |
| 5 | **RN7SL442P** | 31 | 0 | 31 | 0 |

### Key Findings:

- **TP53** is the most frequently altered gene with 38 samples affected, primarily through mutations (33 cases) with some copy number alterations (6 cases)
- The remaining top genes (LINC00901, TRIM16, MYO15A, RN7SL442P) are predominantly altered through copy number changes rather than mutations
- No structural variants were detected in these top 5 genes in this dataset
- TP53 alterations are consistent with its known role as a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in osteosarcoma
