# Question 7

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently altered genes in a structural variant in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET. Let me start by exploring the available data.



Calling `clickhouse_list_tables` with args:
```json
{}
```



Result from `clickhouse_list_tables`:
```json
{"error_message":"Query timed out after 30 seconds"}
```


Let me try a more direct approach. I'll query for the TARGET Osteosarcoma study and look for structural variant data.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT cancer_study_identifier, name FROM cancer_study WHERE cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%osteosarcoma%' OR cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%TARGET%' OR name LIKE '%Osteosarcoma%' OR name LIKE '%TARGET%' LIMIT 20"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"cancer_study_identifier":"all_phase2_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Acute Lymphoid Leukemia - Phase II (TARGET, 2018)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"aml_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TARGET, 2018)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"nbl_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"rt_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Rhabdoid Tumor (TARGET, 2018)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"wt_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Wilms' Tumor (TARGET, 2018)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"alal_target_gdc","name":"Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage (TARGET GDC, 2025)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"aml_target_gdc","name":"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TARGET GDC, 2025)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"bll_target_gdc","name":"B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"nbl_target_gdc","name":"Neuroblastoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)"},{"cancer_study_identifier":"wt_target_gdc","name":"Wilms' Tumor (TARGET GDC, 2025)"}]}
```


Great! I found the Osteosarcoma study: `os_target_gdc`. Now let me check for structural variant data in the genomic_event_derived table.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT DISTINCT variant_type FROM genomic_event_derived WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc' LIMIT 20"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"variant_type":"cna"},{"variant_type":"mutation"}]}
```


Let me check if there's a separate table for structural variants or if they might be in a different format.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT genetic_alteration_type, stable_id FROM genetic_profile WHERE cancer_study_id = (SELECT cancer_study_id FROM cancer_study WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc') LIMIT 20"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"genetic_alteration_type":"COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_cna"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MUTATION_EXTENDED","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mutations"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm_Zscores"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm_Zscores"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_rna_seq_mrna"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_read_counts_Zscores"}]}
```


I don't see a structural variant profile in the genetic profiles. Let me check if there's a structural_variant table or if structural variants might be stored elsewhere.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT name FROM system.tables WHERE database = currentDatabase() AND name LIKE '%struct%' OR name LIKE '%fusion%' OR name LIKE '%sv%'"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"name":"structural_variant"}]}
```


Perfect! There is a `structural_variant` table. Let me examine its structure and query for the top altered genes.



Calling `clickhouse_list_table_columns` with args:
```json
{
  "table": "structural_variant"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_list_table_columns`:
```json
{"columns":[{"name":"internal_id","type":"Nullable(Int64)","comment":"Primary key.

```


Now let me query for the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants for the Osteosarcoma study. I'll need to join with the gene table to get gene symbols and count occurrences.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH sv_genes AS (\n  SELECT \n    sv.site1_entrez_gene_id AS entrez_gene_id\n  FROM structural_variant sv\n  JOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND sv.site1_entrez_gene_id IS NOT NULL\n  \n  UNION ALL\n  \n  SELECT \n    sv.site2_entrez_gene_id AS entrez_gene_id\n  FROM structural_variant sv\n  JOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND sv.site2_entrez_gene_id IS NOT NULL\n)\nSELECT \n  g.hugo_gene_symbol,\n  COUNT(*) AS alteration_count\nFROM sv_genes svg\nJOIN gene g ON svg.entrez_gene_id = g.entrez_gene_id\nGROUP BY g.hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY alteration_count DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"error_message":"Non select queries are forbidden: '\nWITH sv_genes AS (\n  SELECT \n    sv.site1_entrez_gene_id AS entrez_gene_id\n  FROM structural_variant sv\n  JOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND sv.site1_entrez_gene_id IS NOT NULL\n  \n  UNION ALL\n  \n  SELECT \n    sv.site2_entrez_gene_id AS entrez_gene_id\n  FROM structural_variant sv\n  JOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND sv.site2_entrez_gene_id IS NOT NULL\n)\nSELECT \n  g.hugo_gene_symbol,\n  COUNT(*) AS alteration_count\nFROM sv_genes svg\nJOIN gene g ON svg.entrez_gene_id = g.entrez_gene_id\nGROUP BY g.hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY alteration_count DESC\nLIMIT 5\n'. Skipping the query."}
```


Let me try a different approach without the CTE:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n  g.hugo_gene_symbol,\n  COUNT(*) AS alteration_count\nFROM (\n  SELECT sv.site1_entrez_gene_id AS entrez_gene_id\n  FROM structural_variant sv\n  JOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND sv.site1_entrez_gene_id IS NOT NULL\n  \n  UNION ALL\n  \n  SELECT sv.site2_entrez_gene_id AS entrez_gene_id\n  FROM structural_variant sv\n  JOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND sv.site2_entrez_gene_id IS NOT NULL\n) AS sv_genes\nJOIN gene g ON sv_genes.entrez_gene_id = g.entrez_gene_id\nGROUP BY g.hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY alteration_count DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[]}
```


The query returned no results. Let me check if there are any structural variants in this study at all:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS sv_count\nFROM structural_variant sv\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"sv_count":0}]}
```


There are no structural variants in the `os_target_gdc` study. Let me check if there might be another TARGET Osteosarcoma study or if structural variants are available in any TARGET studies:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n  cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n  cs.name,\n  COUNT(*) AS sv_count\nFROM structural_variant sv\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%target%' OR cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%TARGET%'\nGROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\nORDER BY sv_count DESC\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[]}
```


Let me check which studies actually have structural variant data:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n  cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n  cs.name,\n  COUNT(*) AS sv_count\nFROM structural_variant sv\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nGROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\nORDER BY sv_count DESC\nLIMIT 20\n"
}
```

```


Unfortunately, the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (`os_target_gdc`) does not contain structural variant data in this database. Let me verify once more if there are any other osteosarcoma-related studies with structural variants:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n  cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n  cs.name,\n  COUNT(*) AS sv_count\nFROM structural_variant sv\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.name LIKE '%Osteosarcoma%' OR cs.name LIKE '%osteosarcoma%' OR cs.name LIKE '%Sarcoma%'\nGROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\nORDER BY sv_count DESC\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"cancer_study_identifier":"sarcoma_msk_2022","cs.name":"Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma (MSK, Nat Commun 2022)","sv_count":3771},{"cancer_study_identifier":"sarc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","cs.name":"Sarcoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","sv_count":2217},{"cancer_study_identifier":"sarcoma_mskcc_2022","cs.name":"Sarcoma (MSK, Nat Commun. 2022)","sv_count":813},{"cancer_study_identifier":"es_dsrct_msk_2023","cs.name":"Ewing Sarcoma (MSK, 2023)","sv_count":443},{"cancer_study_identifier":"soft_tissue_msk_2025","cs.name":"Soft Tissue Sarcoma (MSK, 2025)","sv_count":231},{"cancer_study_identifier":"sarcoma_ucla_2024","cs.name":"Sarcoma (UCLA, Cell 2024)","sv_count":63},{"cancer_study_identifier":"es_dfarber_broad_2014","cs.name":"Pediatric Ewing Sarcoma (DFCI, Cancer Discov 2014)","sv_count":41},{"cancer_study_identifier":"sarcoma_msk_2023","cs.name":"Sarcoma (MSK, J Pathol 2023)","sv_count":30},{"cancer_study_identifier":"usarc_msk_2020","cs.name":"Uterine Sarcoma/Mesenchymal (MSK, Clin Cancer Res 2020)","sv_count":19}]}
```


Based on my search, **the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc) does not contain structural variant data** in the cBioPortal database.

However, I found that there are sarcoma studies with structural variant data available, including:
- **Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma (MSK, Nat Commun 2022)** - 3,771 structural variants
- **Sarcoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** - 2,217 structural variants

The TARGET Osteosarcoma study appears to only have mutation and copy number alteration data, but not structural variant data. This is a limitation of the available genomic profiling for this particular study.

If you're interested in structural variants in sarcomas (which would include osteosarcoma as a subtype), I could analyze one of the sarcoma studies listed above instead. Would you like me to do that?
