# Question 10

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll find the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD study by querying the genomic_event_derived table.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as num_samples_mutated,\n    COUNT(*) as total_mutations\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol != ''\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY num_samples_mutated DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TP53","num_samples_mutated":13124,"total_mutations":13876},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"KRAS","num_samples_mutated":7128,"total_mutations":7231},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"APC","num_samples_mutated":4777,"total_mutations":7187},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"PIK3CA","num_samples_mutated":3708,"total_mutations":4178},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"EGFR","num_samples_mutated":2159,"total_mutations":2556}]}
```


The top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study are:

1. **TP53** - Mutated in 13,124 samples (13,876 total mutations)
2. **KRAS** - Mutated in 7,128 samples (7,231 total mutations)
3. **APC** - Mutated in 4,777 samples (7,187 total mutations)
4. **PIK3CA** - Mutated in 3,708 samples (4,178 total mutations)
5. **EGFR** - Mutated in 2,159 samples (2,556 total mutations)

These results show that TP53 is by far the most commonly mutated gene in this study, appearing in over 13,000 samples. This is consistent with TP53's well-known role as a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently altered across many cancer types. The other genes (KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, and EGFR) are also well-established cancer-associated genes involved in cell signaling, growth regulation, and DNA repair pathways.
