# Question 9

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What is the median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study. Let me query the clinical data.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    median(toFloat64(attribute_value)) as median_age\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'phs000468_target_2018_pub'\n  AND attribute_name = 'AGE'\n  AND attribute_value != 'NA'\n  AND attribute_value != ''\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"median_age":NaN}]}
```


Let me first check what studies are available and find the correct identifier for the TARGET study:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT cancer_study_identifier, name, description\nFROM cancer_study\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%target%' OR name LIKE '%TARGET%' OR name LIKE '%osteosarcoma%'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

Great! I found the osteosarcoma TARGET study. It's identified as "os_target_gdc". Now let me query for the median age at diagnosis:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    median(toFloat64(attribute_value)) as median_age\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n  AND attribute_name = 'AGE'\n  AND attribute_value != 'NA'\n  AND attribute_value != ''\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"median_age":18.0}]}
```


Perfect! Let me also get some additional context about the data:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    count(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count,\n    min(toFloat64(attribute_value)) as min_age,\n    max(toFloat64(attribute_value)) as max_age,\n    avg(toFloat64(attribute_value)) as mean_age\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n  AND attribute_name = 'AGE'\n  AND attribute_value != 'NA'\n  AND attribute_value != ''\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"patient_count":293,"min_age":18.0,"max_age":87.0,"mean_age":19.66552901023891}]}
```


## Answer

The **median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study is 18 years**.

Additional context:
- **Number of patients**: 293 patients with age data
- **Age range**: 18 to 87 years
- **Mean age**: 19.7 years

This data comes from the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), which is part of the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative focused on pediatric cancers. The median age of 18 years is consistent with osteosarcoma being primarily a pediatric and young adult cancer, with peak incidence during adolescence.
