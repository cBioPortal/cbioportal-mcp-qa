What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies the top 5 genes (TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, EGFR) in the correct order. However, it provides absolute numbers (13,124 samples, 7,128 samples, etc.) instead of the percentages shown in the expected answer (52.4%, 28.5%, 19.1%, 14.8%, 8.6%). While the raw numbers are accurate from the query results, the expected format was percentages, making this partially accurate.",2,"The answer identifies all 5 genes correctly but does not provide the mutation frequencies as percentages, which appears to be the expected format based on the provided answer. The LLM would need to calculate percentages from the total number of samples in the study to fully complete the answer as expected.",2,"The core answer listing the 5 genes is clear, but the output includes additional commentary about TP53 being 'by far the most commonly mutated' and explanatory text about the genes' roles in cancer pathways. While informative, this goes beyond what was asked and makes the response somewhat verbose.",3,The LLM output is entirely based on the query results from the cbioportal database. The gene names and sample counts come directly from the database query. The additional context about these genes being cancer-associated is general biological knowledge that supports but doesn't contradict the data-driven answer.
