# Question 2

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the number of patients and samples in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the database to get this information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT \n    COUNT(DISTINCT p.internal_id) as patient_count,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT s.internal_id) as sample_count\nFROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.cancer_study cs\nJOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.patient p ON cs.cancer_study_id = p.cancer_study_id\nJOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.sample s ON p.internal_id = s.patient_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"patient_count":24950,"sample_count":25040}]}
```


The MSK-CHORD study contains:
- **24,950 patients**
- **25,040 samples**

This indicates that most patients have one sample, but some patients have multiple samples (since there are 90 more samples than patients). This is common in cancer studies where patients may have samples taken from different time points or different anatomical sites.
