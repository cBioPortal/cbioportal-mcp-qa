# Question 3

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the number of primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the database to get this information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) as primary_sample_count\nFROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.clinical_data_derived cdd\nJOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.cancer_study cs ON cdd.cancer_study_identifier = cs.cancer_study_identifier\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\nAND cdd.attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'\nAND cdd.attribute_value = 'Primary'"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"primary_sample_count":15928}]}
```


The MSK-CHORD study contains **15,928 primary samples**.

This count represents samples that are specifically classified as "Primary" sample type in the clinical data, which typically refers to tumor samples taken directly from the primary tumor site (as opposed to metastatic sites, recurrent tumors, or other sample types).
