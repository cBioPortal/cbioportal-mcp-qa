# Question 5

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET. Let me first check what studies are available in the database to find the correct TARGET osteosarcoma study identifier.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT cancer_study_identifier, name, description \nFROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.cancer_study \nWHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%osteosarcoma%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%target%' OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%osteosarcoma%' OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%target%'"
}
```

Perfect! I found the TARGET osteosarcoma study. It's called "os_target_gdc" with the name "Osteosarcoma (TARGET, GDC)". Now let me query for the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in this study using the genomic_event_derived table.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as mutated_samples,\n    COUNT(*) as total_mutations\nFROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.genomic_event_derived \nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc' \n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol IS NOT NULL\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol != ''\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY mutated_samples DESC, total_mutations DESC\nLIMIT 5"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TP53","mutated_samples":32,"total_mutations":33},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TTN","mutated_samples":16,"total_mutations":18},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"MUC16","mutated_samples":16,"total_mutations":17},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"ATRX","mutated_samples":11,"total_mutations":11},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"DNAH9","mutated_samples":10,"total_mutations":10}]}
```


Let me also get the total number of samples in this study to provide context for the mutation frequencies:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as total_samples\nFROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.genomic_event_derived \nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_samples":156}]}
```


Based on my analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes**:

## Top 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in TARGET Osteosarcoma Study

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Mutated Samples | Total Mutations | Mutation Frequency |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 32 | 33 | 20.5% |
| 2 | **TTN** | 16 | 18 | 10.3% |
| 3 | **MUC16** | 16 | 17 | 10.3% |
| 4 | **ATRX** | 11 | 11 | 7.1% |
| 5 | **DNAH9** | 10 | 10 | 6.4% |

### Key Findings:

- **Total samples analyzed**: 156 osteosarcoma samples
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in 32 samples (20.5% of cases), which is consistent with its role as a critical tumor suppressor gene
- **TTN** (Titin) and **MUC16** (Mucin 16) are tied for second place, each mutated in 16 samples (10.3%)
- **ATRX** (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked) is mutated in 11 samples (7.1%)
- **DNAH9** (Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain 9) rounds out the top 5 with mutations in 10 samples (6.4%)

The TP53 mutation frequency of ~20% in this pediatric osteosarcoma cohort aligns with known literature about the importance of p53 pathway disruption in osteosarcoma development.
