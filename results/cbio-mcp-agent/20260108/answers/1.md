# Question 1

**Type:** Data Discovery

**Question:** How many studies are in cBioPortal?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find out how many studies are in cBioPortal by querying the cancer_study table.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_studies FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.cancer_study"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_studies":492}]}
```


There are **492 studies** currently available in cBioPortal based on this database snapshot from June 24, 2025.

If you'd like to see more details about these studies, such as their names, descriptions, or specific study identifiers, I can help you explore that information as well.
