How many studies are in cBioPortal?,3,"The LLM output correctly states there are 492 studies in cBioPortal, which matches the expected answer exactly.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of studies (492) and even offers additional help if the user wants more details about the studies.,2,"The core answer is concise, but the output includes some unnecessary formatting elements like 'Question 1', 'Type: Data Discovery', and model information that don't add value to answering the specific question.",3,The answer is based entirely on querying the cBioPortal database as specified in the context. The LLM executed a SQL query against the cancer_study table and reported the results directly without adding external information.
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The output correctly states 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which exactly matches the expected answer.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the patient count and sample count as requested.,2,"The core answer is concise, but the output includes additional interpretation about why there are more samples than patients, which while informative, goes beyond what was asked.",3,"The numerical data comes directly from the database query results. The additional interpretation about multiple samples per patient is a reasonable inference based on the data provided, not external knowledge."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The output correctly states that there are 15,928 primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study, which exactly matches the expected answer.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of primary samples requested.,2,"While the core answer is direct, the output includes additional explanatory text about what 'primary samples' means, which, though informative, makes it somewhat verbose for a straightforward numerical question.",3,The answer is based entirely on the database query result from the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The additional explanation about primary samples is general medical knowledge that doesn't contradict the source.
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM output does not provide any answer to the question. It only shows an error message stating 'Error connecting to agent', so there is no factual information to evaluate for correctness.",1,"The LLM output completely fails to address the user's question. Instead of providing information about the most common treatment in the MSK-CHORD Study, it only displays an error message.",3,"While the output doesn't answer the question, the error message itself is concise and direct without unnecessary verbosity.",3,The output doesn't contain any hallucinations or external information since it only displays an error message. It doesn't attempt to provide information from outside the context or make up an answer.
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM correctly identified the top 5 genes and their ranking, but the mutation frequencies are incorrect. The expected answer shows TP53 at 22.4% but the LLM calculated 20.5%. Similarly, MUC16 should be 11.2% but was calculated as 10.3%, and other frequencies also differ from the expected values.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing all 5 requested genes with their mutation frequencies, sample counts, and additional context about the study.",2,"While the core answer is present, the output includes extensive additional details like table formatting, key findings section, and background information that, while useful, make it somewhat verbose for a straightforward frequency question.",3,The LLM relied entirely on database queries to the cbioportal database as specified in the context. All information was derived from the provided data source without external knowledge or hallucinations.
