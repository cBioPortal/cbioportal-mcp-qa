How many studies are in cBioPortal?,3,"The LLM Output states there are 492 studies in cBioPortal, which exactly matches the expected answer of 492 studies.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of studies in cBioPortal. The query execution and result are shown, and the final answer is clearly stated.",3,"Excluding the SQL query and metadata (as instructed), the actual answer 'There are **492 studies** in cBioPortal.' is direct and to the point with no unnecessary elaboration.",3,"The answer is derived entirely from the database query result shown in the output. The LLM queried the cBioPortal database and reported the result directly, with no external information or hallucinations."
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output states 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which exactly matches the expected answer of '24,950 Patients and 25,040 samples'.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the patient count and sample count for the MSK-CHORD Study. It even adds helpful context about the relationship between patients and samples.,2,"The core answer is concise and direct. However, the additional observation about '90 additional samples beyond the patient count' and the interpretation that 'most patients have one sample' is somewhat unnecessary detail that goes beyond what was asked.",3,"The answer is entirely based on the database query results shown in the context. The numbers 24,950 and 25,040 come directly from the query output, and the additional interpretation about multiple samples is a simple mathematical observation derived from those same numbers."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output states there are 15,928 primary samples, which exactly matches the expected answer of '15,928 primary samples'.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact count of primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study. No additional information was needed.,3,"The answer is direct and to the point, stating 'There are **15,928 primary samples** in the MSK-CHORD study.' The SQL query and metadata are appropriately included for transparency but are excluded from conciseness evaluation as instructed.",3,"The answer is derived entirely from the cbioportal database query result shown in the output. The LLM queried the clinical_data_derived table and reported the exact count returned by the database (15,928), with no external information or hallucinations."
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies Fluorouracil as the most common specific treatment agent (6,319 patients), which matches the expected answer. The data is accurately extracted from the query results.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by identifying both the most common treatment type (Medical Therapy) and the most common specific treatment agent (Fluorouracil). It provides comprehensive information including a ranked list of the top 10 treatment agents.,2,"While the core answer is clear, the output includes additional context about combination therapies (FOLFOX) and cancer types that, while informative, goes beyond what was strictly asked. The top 10 list is useful but could be considered somewhat verbose for a question asking about 'most patients.'",3,"The answer is entirely based on the query results from the cbioportal database. The patient counts and treatment names are directly traceable to the database query results. The only external knowledge is the brief explanation about FOLFOX and cancer types, but this is clearly marked as contextual information rather than data claims."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies the top 5 genes (TP53, MUC16, TTN, ATRX, DNAH9) in the correct order. However, it provides absolute numbers (32, 16, 16, 11, 10 samples) rather than percentages. The expected answer shows percentages (22.4%, 11.2%, 11.2%, 7.7%, 7.0%), which would require knowing the total number of samples in the study. The genes and their relative ranking are correct, but the format differs from the expected answer.",2,"The answer identifies all 5 genes correctly but does not provide the mutation frequencies as percentages, which is what the expected answer format shows. To fully address the question as intended, the LLM would need to calculate the percentage of samples with mutations in each gene relative to the total number of samples in the study.",2,"The core answer is provided clearly, but the output includes additional interpretive commentary about the biological significance of each gene (e.g., 'TP53 is by far the most frequently mutated gene...', 'MUC16 and TTN are tied for second place...', descriptions of gene functions). While potentially useful context, this goes beyond what was asked and makes the response more verbose than necessary.",3,"The LLM Output is entirely based on the database query results from the cbioportal database. The gene names and sample counts come directly from the query results. While the LLM adds biological context about gene functions, this is presented as general knowledge rather than claims about the specific study data, and the core numerical findings are faithful to the source data."
