# Question 3

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the number of primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the database to get this information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT COUNT(*) as primary_sample_count\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n  AND attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'\n  AND attribute_value = 'Primary'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"primary_sample_count":15928}]}
```


There are **15,928 primary samples** in the MSK-CHORD study.
