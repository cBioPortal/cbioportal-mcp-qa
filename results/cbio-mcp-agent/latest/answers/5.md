# Question 5

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET. Let me first check what studies are available and then query the mutation data.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT cancer_study_identifier, name, description FROM cancer_study WHERE cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%osteosarcoma%' OR cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%TARGET%' OR name LIKE '%Osteosarcoma%' OR name LIKE '%TARGET%'"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

Perfect! I found the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET: `os_target_gdc`. Now let me query for the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in this study.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as num_samples_mutated,\n    COUNT(*) as total_mutations\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol != ''\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY num_samples_mutated DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TP53","num_samples_mutated":32,"total_mutations":33},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"MUC16","num_samples_mutated":16,"total_mutations":17},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TTN","num_samples_mutated":16,"total_mutations":18},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"ATRX","num_samples_mutated":11,"total_mutations":11},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"DNAH9","num_samples_mutated":10,"total_mutations":10}]}
```


Excellent! Here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes** in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET:

1. **TP53** - Mutated in 32 samples (33 total mutations)
2. **MUC16** - Mutated in 16 samples (17 total mutations)
3. **TTN** - Mutated in 16 samples (18 total mutations)
4. **ATRX** - Mutated in 11 samples (11 total mutations)
5. **DNAH9** - Mutated in 10 samples (10 total mutations)

**Key findings:**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene in osteosarcoma, which is consistent with its well-known role as a tumor suppressor gene frequently altered in many cancers, including osteosarcoma.
- **MUC16** and **TTN** are tied for second place with mutations in 16 samples each. These genes are very large and often show mutations across many cancer types.
- **ATRX** is a chromatin remodeling gene that has been implicated in various cancers.
- **DNAH9** is a dynein gene that is also frequently mutated in various cancers.
