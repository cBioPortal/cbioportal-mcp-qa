# Question 2

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll query the database to find the number of patients and samples in the MSK-CHORD study.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    COUNT(DISTINCT p.internal_id) as patient_count,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT s.internal_id) as sample_count\nFROM cancer_study cs\nJOIN patient p ON cs.cancer_study_id = p.cancer_study_id\nJOIN sample s ON p.internal_id = s.patient_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"patient_count":24950,"sample_count":25040}]}
```


The MSK-CHORD Study contains:
- **24,950 patients**
- **25,040 samples**

This indicates that most patients have one sample, with a small number having multiple samples (90 additional samples beyond the patient count).
