# Question 4

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most common treatment received by patients in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the clinical event data for treatment information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    value as treatment,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count\nFROM clinical_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND key = 'TREATMENT_TYPE'\n    AND value != ''\nGROUP BY value\nORDER BY patient_count DESC\nLIMIT 10\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"treatment":"Medical Therapy","patient_count":19551}]}
```


Let me also check for specific treatment agents to provide more detail:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    value as treatment_agent,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count\nFROM clinical_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND key = 'AGENT'\n    AND value != ''\nGROUP BY value\nORDER BY patient_count DESC\nLIMIT 10\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"treatment_agent":"FLUOROURACIL","patient_count":6319},{"treatment_agent":"LEUCOVORIN","patient_count":5573},{"treatment_agent":"OXALIPLATIN","patient_count":5489},{"treatment_agent":"CAPECITABINE","patient_count":4808},{"treatment_agent":"CARBOPLATIN","patient_count":4604},{"treatment_agent":"IRINOTECAN","patient_count":4329},{"treatment_agent":"INVESTIGATIONAL","patient_count":4114},{"treatment_agent":"GEMCITABINE","patient_count":4038},{"treatment_agent":"LEUPROLIDE","patient_count":3708},{"treatment_agent":"PACLITAXEL","patient_count":3679}]}
```


Based on the MSK-CHORD study data:

## Most Common Treatment Type:
**Medical Therapy** - received by 19,551 patients

## Most Common Specific Treatment Agents (Top 10):
1. **FLUOROURACIL** - 6,319 patients
2. **LEUCOVORIN** - 5,573 patients
3. **OXALIPLATIN** - 5,489 patients
4. **CAPECITABINE** - 4,808 patients
5. **CARBOPLATIN** - 4,604 patients
6. **IRINOTECAN** - 4,329 patients
7. **INVESTIGATIONAL** - 4,114 patients
8. **GEMCITABINE** - 4,038 patients
9. **LEUPROLIDE** - 3,708 patients
10. **PACLITAXEL** - 3,679 patients

The most common treatment category was **Medical Therapy** (chemotherapy/systemic therapy), and the most frequently used specific drug was **Fluorouracil** (5-FU), a chemotherapy agent commonly used to treat various cancers including colorectal, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers. Many of the top agents (Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin) are often used together in combination chemotherapy regimens like FOLFOX.
