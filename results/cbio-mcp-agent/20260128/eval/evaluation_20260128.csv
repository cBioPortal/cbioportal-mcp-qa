How many studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM Output states there are 511 studies, but the Expected Answer is 492 studies. This is a factual discrepancy of 19 studies, making the answer incorrect.",3,The output fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of studies in cBioPortal. It directly answers what was asked.,3,"The answer itself ('There are **511 studies** in cBioPortal.') is direct and to the point. Excluding the SQL query and metadata as instructed, the response is appropriately concise.",3,The LLM Output relies entirely on the provided context/source (cbioportal database). It queries the database directly and reports the result from that query without adding external information or hallucinations.
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output states 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which exactly matches the expected answer of '24,950 Patients and 25,040 samples'.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the patient count and sample count for the MSK-CHORD Study. It also adds helpful context about the relationship between patients and samples.,2,"The core answer is concise and direct. However, the additional observation about most patients having one sample and the slight difference in counts, while informative, adds some verbosity beyond what was strictly asked.",3,"The answer is entirely based on the database query results shown in the context. The observation about the patient-to-sample ratio is a reasonable inference from the provided data (24,950 vs 25,040) and does not introduce external information or hallucinations."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly states there are 15,928 primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study, which matches the expected answer exactly.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of primary samples. It also provides helpful additional context about other sample types in the study.,2,"While the core answer is direct and clear, the output includes additional context about other sample types (metastasis, unknown, local recurrence) that, while informative, was not requested in the original question. The answer could have been more concise by simply stating the number of primary samples.",3,"All information in the LLM Output is directly derived from the database queries shown. The primary sample count of 15,928 and the additional sample type counts are all traceable to the query results from the cbioportal database."
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies FLUOROURACIL as the most common treatment, which matches the expected answer exactly. The patient count of 6,319 is directly from the query results.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by clearly stating that FLUOROURACIL was the most commonly received treatment and providing supporting data including the patient count.,2,"While the core answer is provided clearly at the beginning, the output includes additional context about the top 5 treatments and an explanation about combination regimens (FOLFOX) that, while informative, goes beyond what was asked. The question only asked for the most common treatment, not additional rankings or clinical context.",2,"The primary answer (FLUOROURACIL with 6,319 patients) and the top 5 treatment list are faithful to the query results. However, the statement about FOLFOX regimen being 'commonly used to treat colorectal cancer' and the assertion that 'the MSK-CHORD study includes a significant number of gastrointestinal cancer patients' appears to be external knowledge not directly supported by the provided query results, which only show treatment agents without cancer type information."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies the top 5 genes (TP53, MUC16, TTN, ATRX, DNAH9) in the correct order. However, the percentages are incorrect. The expected answer shows TP53 at 22.4% (which would be ~32/143 samples), but the LLM reports ~20% (32/160 samples). The discrepancy suggests either a different sample count denominator or the LLM is calculating percentages from a different total. The raw numbers (32, 16, 16, 11, 10) appear correct, but the percentage calculations don't match the expected answer.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing all 5 requested genes with their mutation frequencies. It goes beyond the minimum requirement by including both sample counts and total mutation counts, plus contextual information about each gene's biological significance.",2,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the output includes additional commentary about each gene's biological role and significance that, while informative, makes the response somewhat verbose. The key findings section adds value but extends beyond what was strictly asked.",3,"The LLM output is based entirely on data retrieved from the cbioportal database through the queries shown. The gene names, sample counts, and mutation counts are all directly traceable to the query results. The biological context provided (e.g., TP53 as tumor suppressor, ATRX's role) represents general scientific knowledge but doesn't contradict or misrepresent the database results."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies the top 5 genes (TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, EGFR) in the correct order. However, it provides absolute sample counts instead of the percentages shown in the expected answer (TP53 52.4%, KRAS 28.5%, APC 19.1%, PIK3CA 14.8%, EGFR 8.6%). While the raw numbers are accurate based on the query results, the format doesn't match the expected answer format, which would be more useful for comparison.",2,"The answer identifies all 5 genes correctly but is incomplete in presentation format. The expected answer provides percentages which give context about the proportion of samples affected, while the LLM output only provides absolute counts. To fully address the question as expected, the output should have calculated and presented the mutation frequencies as percentages of the total sample population.",2,"The core answer is provided clearly, but the 'Key observations' section adds interpretive commentary about the biological significance of these genes that, while informative, goes beyond what was asked. The question simply requested the top 5 most frequently mutated genes, not an analysis of their biological roles or patterns.",3,"The LLM output is entirely based on the database query results from the cbioportal database. The gene names and sample counts are directly derived from the query results. While the 'Key observations' section includes general knowledge about these genes' roles in cancer, this is clearly marked as interpretation and doesn't misrepresent the source data."
How many total studies contain mutation data in the cBioPortal database?,2,"The LLM Output states there are 508 studies with mutation data, while the expected answer is 506 studies. This is a minor discrepancy of 2 studies, which could be due to database updates or slight differences in counting methodology, but it's not perfectly accurate.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific count of studies containing mutation data and explains the methodology used (studies with MUTATION_EXTENDED genetic profiles).,3,"The output is direct and to the point. It provides the answer (508 studies) and includes a brief, relevant explanation about the MUTATION_EXTENDED profile type without unnecessary verbosity.",3,The answer is based entirely on the query results from the cBioPortal database. The LLM executed a SQL query against the database and reported the results (508 studies) without adding external information or hallucinations.
How many unique patients have both primary and metastatic samples in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies 26 unique patients as having both primary and metastatic samples, which matches the expected answer of 26 patients exactly.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the specific number requested (26 patients) and includes additional context about what this finding means for studying tumor evolution and metastatic progression.,3,"The output is appropriately concise. It directly answers the question with '26 unique patients' and includes only one brief, relevant sentence explaining the significance of this finding. There are no unnecessary details or excessive verbosity.",3,The answer is entirely based on the query results from the cbioportal database. The LLM correctly interprets the database query results and provides an answer that is directly traceable to the source data. The additional interpretive comment about tumor evolution is a reasonable inference from the data context but does not constitute hallucination or unsupported claims.
What percentage of colorectal cancer samples have KRAS mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output provides the correct percentage (42.49%, which rounds to 42.5% as in the expected answer), the correct number of mutated samples (2,355), and the correct total number of samples (5,543). All numerical values match the expected answer.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the percentage of KRAS mutations, along with supporting details including the absolute numbers of mutated and total samples. It completely answers what was asked.",2,"While the core answer is clear and direct, the output includes additional contextual information about KRAS mutations being consistent with literature (40-50% range) and their clinical significance for anti-EGFR therapy. This information, while relevant, goes beyond what was strictly asked and makes the response somewhat verbose.",2,"The primary data (42.49%, 2,355 out of 5,543 samples) comes directly from the database query results. However, the output includes external knowledge not present in the provided context, such as the statement that 'KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal cancer, typically occurring in 40-50% of cases' and information about anti-EGFR therapy eligibility. These additions rely on general medical knowledge rather than the cbioportal database source."
What is the correlation between tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability status in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM Output reports a correlation coefficient of 0.6036 using a binary encoding (Instable=1, Stable=0), which is a Pearson correlation. However, the Expected Answer specifies a Spearman coefficient of 0.37 and Pearson coefficient of 0.58 when using continuous MSI scores. The LLM used MSI_TYPE (categorical) rather than MSI_SCORE (continuous), leading to different correlation values. The descriptive statistics (mean TMB by MSI status) are accurate, but the correlation methodology differs from the expected approach.",2,"The LLM Output addresses the correlation between TMB and MSI status and provides extensive descriptive statistics. However, it misses the key element mentioned in the Expected Answer: the use of continuous MSI scores for correlation analysis. The Expected Answer specifically mentions both Spearman (0.37) and Pearson (0.58) coefficients using MSI_SCORE, while the LLM only calculated correlation using binary MSI_TYPE. The output does confirm the categorical separation pattern mentioned in the Expected Answer.",2,"The output provides valuable information but includes extensive tables and breakdowns that, while informative, go beyond what was necessary to answer the core question about correlation. The clinical implications section and detailed distribution analysis add context but make the response somewhat verbose compared to the more focused Expected Answer.",3,"The LLM Output is entirely based on queries to the cbioportal database as specified in the Context/Source. All statistics, correlation coefficients, and findings are derived directly from the database queries shown in the output. No external information or hallucinations are present."
