How many studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM Output states there are 511 studies, but the Expected Answer is 492 studies. This is a factual discrepancy of 19 studies, making the answer incorrect.",3,The output fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of studies in cBioPortal. It directly answers what was asked.,3,"The answer itself ('There are **511 studies** in cBioPortal.') is direct and to the point. Excluding the SQL query and metadata as instructed, the response is appropriately concise.",3,The LLM Output relies entirely on the provided context/source (cbioportal database). It queries the database directly and reports the result from that query without adding external information or hallucinations.
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output states 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which exactly matches the expected answer of '24,950 Patients and 25,040 samples'.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the patient count and sample count for the MSK-CHORD Study. It also adds helpful context about the relationship between patients and samples.,2,"The core answer is concise and direct. However, the additional observation about most patients having one sample and the slight difference in counts, while informative, adds some verbosity beyond what was strictly asked.",3,"The answer is entirely based on the database query results shown in the context. The observation about the patient-to-sample ratio is a reasonable inference from the provided data (24,950 vs 25,040) and does not introduce external information or hallucinations."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly states there are 15,928 primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study, which matches the expected answer exactly.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of primary samples. It also provides helpful additional context about other sample types in the study.,2,"While the core answer is direct and clear, the output includes additional context about other sample types (metastasis, unknown, local recurrence) that, while informative, was not requested in the original question. The answer could have been more concise by simply stating the number of primary samples.",3,"All information in the LLM Output is directly derived from the database queries shown. The primary sample count of 15,928 and the additional sample type counts are all traceable to the query results from the cbioportal database."
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies FLUOROURACIL as the most common treatment, which matches the expected answer exactly. The patient count of 6,319 is directly from the query results.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by clearly stating that FLUOROURACIL was the most commonly received treatment and providing supporting data including the patient count.,2,"While the core answer is provided clearly at the beginning, the output includes additional context about the top 5 treatments and an explanation about combination regimens (FOLFOX) that, while informative, goes beyond what was asked. The question only asked for the most common treatment, not additional rankings or clinical context.",2,"The primary answer (FLUOROURACIL with 6,319 patients) and the top 5 treatment list are faithful to the query results. However, the statement about FOLFOX regimen being 'commonly used to treat colorectal cancer' and the assertion that 'the MSK-CHORD study includes a significant number of gastrointestinal cancer patients' appears to be external knowledge not directly supported by the provided query results, which only show treatment agents without cancer type information."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies the top 5 genes (TP53, MUC16, TTN, ATRX, DNAH9) in the correct order. However, the percentages are incorrect. The expected answer shows TP53 at 22.4% (which would be ~32/143 samples), but the LLM reports ~20% (32/160 samples). The discrepancy suggests either a different sample count denominator or the LLM is calculating percentages from a different total. The raw numbers (32, 16, 16, 11, 10) appear correct, but the percentage calculations don't match the expected answer.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing all 5 requested genes with their mutation frequencies. It goes beyond the minimum requirement by including both sample counts and total mutation counts, plus contextual information about each gene's biological significance.",2,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the output includes additional commentary about each gene's biological role and significance that, while informative, makes the response somewhat verbose. The key findings section adds value but extends beyond what was strictly asked.",3,"The LLM output is based entirely on data retrieved from the cbioportal database through the queries shown. The gene names, sample counts, and mutation counts are all directly traceable to the query results. The biological context provided (e.g., TP53 as tumor suppressor, ATRX's role) represents general scientific knowledge but doesn't contradict or misrepresent the database results."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies the top 5 genes (TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, EGFR) in the correct order. However, it provides absolute sample counts instead of the percentages shown in the expected answer (TP53 52.4%, KRAS 28.5%, APC 19.1%, PIK3CA 14.8%, EGFR 8.6%). While the raw numbers are accurate based on the query results, the format doesn't match the expected answer format, which would be more useful for comparison.",2,"The answer identifies all 5 genes correctly but is incomplete in presentation format. The expected answer provides percentages which give context about the proportion of samples affected, while the LLM output only provides absolute counts. To fully address the question as expected, the LLM should have calculated and presented the mutation frequencies as percentages of the total sample population.",2,"The core answer is present but surrounded by additional observations and interpretations about cancer biology (e.g., 'consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor gene', 'often mutated in colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers'). While these insights may be valuable, they make the response more verbose than necessary for simply answering what the top 5 mutated genes are.",2,"The gene names and sample counts are faithful to the database query results. However, the 'Key observations' section includes external knowledge about cancer biology (e.g., TP53's role as a tumor suppressor, KRAS mutations in specific cancer types, genes involved in 'cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and growth control') that is not derived from the provided context/source but from general oncology knowledge."
