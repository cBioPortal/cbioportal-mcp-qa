**Question:** How many studies are in cBioPortal?

**Answer:**

I'll query the database to find out how many studies are in cBioPortal.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_studies FROM cancer_study"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_studies":511}]}
```


There are **511 studies** in cBioPortal.
