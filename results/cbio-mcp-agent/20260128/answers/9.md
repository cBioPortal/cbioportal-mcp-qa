# Question 9

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What is the median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study. Let me start by searching for the TARGET study and then query the relevant data.



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "TARGET"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json
[{"cancer_study_identifier":"aml_target_gdc","name":"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"aml","sample_count":2767,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"all_phase2_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Acute Lymphoid Leukemia - Phase II (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"bll","sample_count":1979,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"nbl_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"nbl","sample_count":1090,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"aml_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"aml","sample_count":1026,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"bll_target_gdc","name":"B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"bll","sample_count":990,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"wt_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Wilms' Tumor (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"wt","sample_count":658,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"nbl_target_gdc","name":"Neuroblastoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"nbl","sample_count":534,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"alal_target_gdc","name":"Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"alal","sample_count":252,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"os","sample_count":160,"has_guide":true},{"cancer_study_identifier":"wt_target_gdc","name":"Wilms' Tumor (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"wt","sample_count":133,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"rt_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Rhabdoid Tumor (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"mrt","sample_count":73,"has_guide":false}]

Great! I found the osteosarcoma TARGET study: "os_target_gdc" (Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)). Let me get the study guide and then query for the age at diagnosis data.



Calling `get_study_guide` with args:
```json
{
  "study_id": "os_target_gdc"
}
```



Result from `get_study_guide`:

# Osteosarcoma (TARGET, 2018)

**Study ID:** `os_target_gdc`

## Overview
Pediatric osteosarcoma study from the TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) initiative. Whole exome sequencing data.

## Gene Panel
- **WES** (Whole Exome Sequencing): All coding genes profiled
- For mutation frequency calculations, you can use study-wide sample counts as the denominator (all genes equally covered)

## Clinical Attributes - Semantic Guide

### Patient Demographics
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `AGE` | Age at diagnosis | In years; pediatric population |
| `SEX` | Patient sex | Male, Female |
| `RACE` | Patient race | Per NIH categories |
| `ETHNICITY` | Patient ethnicity | Hispanic/Latino status |

### Disease Characteristics
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `DISEASE` | Disease type | Should be "Osteosarcoma" |
| `TUMOR_SITE` | Primary tumor location | e.g., Femur, Tibia |
| `HISTOLOGY` | Histological subtype | Osteoblastic, Chondroblastic, etc. |

### Clinical Outcomes
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `OS_MONTHS` | Overall survival in months | Time from diagnosis |
| `OS_STATUS` | Overall survival status | 0:LIVING, 1:DECEASED |
| `EFS_MONTHS` | Event-free survival in months | Time to first event |

### Treatment Response
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `PERCENT_NECROSIS` | Tumor necrosis percentage post-chemotherapy |

## Notes & Caveats
- This is a pediatric cancer cohort; age distribution is younger than adult studies
- WES coverage means no gene panel filtering needed for frequency calculations
- Part of TARGET consortium; integrated with other pediatric cancer data

```


The data shows an unusual result - let me check if there's a different age attribute or if the data needs to be examined more closely:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    attribute_name,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count,\n    COUNT(*) as value_count\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n  AND attribute_name LIKE '%AGE%'\nGROUP BY attribute_name\nORDER BY attribute_name\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

```

}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:

```


I see the issue - there's a large concentration of patients with age "18", which seems like it might be a data artifact (possibly representing "<18" or redacted pediatric ages). Let me check if there are other age-related attributes:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    attribute_name,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n  AND (attribute_name LIKE '%AGE%' OR attribute_name LIKE '%BIRTH%' OR attribute_name LIKE '%DIAGNOSIS%')\nGROUP BY attribute_name\nORDER BY attribute_name\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"attribute_name":"AGE","patient_count":383},{"attribute_name":"DAYS_TO_BIRTH","patient_count":383},{"attribute_name":"PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS","patient_count":383}]}
```


Perfect! Let me use `DAYS_TO_BIRTH` to calculate the actual age at diagnosis:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count,\n    median(abs(toFloat64OrNull(attribute_value)) / 365.25) as median_age_years,\n    min(abs(toFloat64OrNull(attribute_value)) / 365.25) as min_age_years,\n    max(abs(toFloat64OrNull(attribute_value)) / 365.25) as max_age_years,\n    quantile(0.25)(abs(toFloat64OrNull(attribute_value)) / 365.25) as q1_age,\n    quantile(0.75)(abs(toFloat64OrNull(attribute_value)) / 365.25) as q3_age\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n  AND attribute_name = 'DAYS_TO_BIRTH'\n  AND attribute_value != ''\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"patient_count":293,"median_age_years":15.159479808350445,"min_age_years":3.5564681724845997,"max_age_years":87.13483915126626,"q1_age":12.219028062970569,"q3_age":17.66461327857632}]}
```


Perfect! Now I have the accurate age data. Let me provide you with a comprehensive answer:

## Median Age at Diagnosis for Osteosarcoma Patients in TARGET Study

**Median Age: 15.2 years**

### Additional Age Statistics:
- **Minimum age:** 3.6 years
- **Maximum age:** 87.1 years
- **First quartile (Q1):** 12.2 years
- **Third quartile (Q3):** 17.7 years
- **Total patients:** 293 patients with age data

### Key Findings:
The median age of **15.2 years** is consistent with osteosarcoma being primarily a pediatric and adolescent cancer. The interquartile range (12.2 to 17.7 years) shows that the majority of patients in this TARGET study were diagnosed during their teenage years, which aligns with the typical peak incidence of osteosarcoma during the adolescent growth spurt.

The presence of some older patients (up to 87 years) represents the bimodal age distribution of osteosarcoma, which has a second, smaller peak in older adults, though the vast majority of cases in this pediatric-focused TARGET study are in the younger age group.
