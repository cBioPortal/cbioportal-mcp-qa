# Question 25

**Type:** Gene Panels

**Question:** What percentage of genomic events in the MSK-CHORD Study occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used)?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the percentage of genomic events that occur in off-panel genes in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me start by exploring the available data structure.

# MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)

**Study ID:** `msk_chord_2024`

## Overview
Targeted sequencing via MSK-IMPACT panels. Clinical annotations include some derived from natural language processing (denoted NLP).

## Gene Panels
This study uses multiple MSK-IMPACT panel versions:
- **IMPACT341**: Earlier version, 341 genes
- **IMPACT410**: 410 genes
- **IMPACT468**: 468 genes  
- **IMPACT505**: Latest version, 505 genes

**Important:** Different samples may have different gene coverage. Always use gene-specific denominators when calculating mutation frequencies.

SELECT 
    subtype.value as treatment_type,
    agent.value as agent,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ce.patient_id) as patients
FROM clinical_event ce
JOIN clinical_event_data agent ON ce.clinical_event_id = agent.clinical_event_id AND agent.key = 'AGENT'
JOIN clinical_event_data subtype ON ce.clinical_event_id = subtype.clinical_event_id AND subtype.key = 'SUBTYPE'
JOIN patient p ON ce.patient_id = p.internal_id
JOIN cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id
WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
  AND ce.event_type IN ('Treatment', 'TREATMENT')
GROUP BY subtype.value, agent.value
ORDER BY treatment_type, patients DESC;
```

### Treatment Data Caveats
- Some treatment data is NLP-extracted (`INFERRED_TX_PROB` indicates confidence)
- `PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK` captures pre-MSK treatments separately
- Treatment timing (start_date, stop_date) is in days from diagnosis

## Notes & Caveats
- Some clinical annotations are NLP-derived and may have extraction errors
- Multiple IMPACT panel versions mean gene coverage varies by sample
- Data is under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license; contact datarequests@mskcc.org for commercial use

Great! I can see there's a `genomic_event_derived` table that includes off-panel detection. Let me examine its structure to understand how off-panel events are tracked.

```


Perfect! The `genomic_event_derived` table has an `off_panel` column that indicates whether each genomic event occurred in a gene not covered by the sequencing panel. Now let me query the data for the MSK-CHORD study.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    off_panel,\n    COUNT(*) as event_count,\n    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () as percentage\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\nGROUP BY off_panel\nORDER BY off_panel\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"off_panel":false,"event_count":276363,"percentage":98.97962838273426},{"off_panel":true,"event_count":2849,"percentage":1.0203716172657336}]}
```


Excellent! Let me also break this down by variant type to provide more context:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    variant_type,\n    off_panel,\n    COUNT(*) as event_count,\n    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY variant_type) as percentage_within_type\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\nGROUP BY variant_type, off_panel\nORDER BY variant_type, off_panel\n"
}
```

```


Now let me get some additional context about which genes are most commonly detected off-panel:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    variant_type,\n    COUNT(*) as off_panel_events,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as samples_affected\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n  AND off_panel = true\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol, variant_type\nORDER BY off_panel_events DESC\nLIMIT 20\n"

## Answer

In the MSK-CHORD study, **1.02%** of genomic events occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used).

### Detailed Breakdown:

**Overall Statistics:**
- **Off-panel events:** 2,849 (1.02%)
- **On-panel events:** 276,363 (98.98%)
- **Total events:** 279,212

**By Variant Type:**

1. **Mutations:** 0.07% off-panel
   - Off-panel: 150 events
   - On-panel: 208,064 events

2. **Copy Number Alterations (CNA):** 0% off-panel
   - All 60,787 CNA events were on-panel

3. **Structural Variants:** 26.43% off-panel
   - Off-panel: 2,699 events
   - On-panel: 7,512 events

### Key Insights:

The vast majority of off-panel events are **structural variants** (fusions/rearrangements), which makes sense because:
- MSK-IMPACT panels are targeted sequencing panels designed to capture specific genes
- Structural variants can involve fusion partners that fall outside the targeted gene list
- Common fusion partners like **EML4** (in EML4-ALK fusions), **KIF5B**, and **CD74** are frequently detected off-panel

The most commonly detected off-panel genes include well-known fusion partners in lung cancer (EML4, KIF5B) and other cancers, suggesting that while the panels are targeted, they can still detect clinically relevant events involving genes outside the panel coverage through their fusion partners that are on-panel.
