# Question 14

**Type:** Data Discovery

**Question:** How many total studies contain mutation data in the cBioPortal database?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find out how many studies contain mutation data in the cBioPortal database.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cs.cancer_study_id) as studies_with_mutation_data\nFROM cancer_study cs\nINNER JOIN genetic_profile gp ON cs.cancer_study_id = gp.cancer_study_id\nWHERE gp.genetic_alteration_type = 'MUTATION_EXTENDED'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"studies_with_mutation_data":508}]}
```


There are **508 studies** in the cBioPortal database that contain mutation data. 

This count is based on studies that have a genetic profile with the alteration type 'MUTATION_EXTENDED', which is the standard profile type for mutation data in cBioPortal.
