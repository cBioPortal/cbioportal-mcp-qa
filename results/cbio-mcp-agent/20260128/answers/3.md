# Question 3

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the number of primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the database to get this information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.internal_id) as primary_sample_count\nFROM sample s\nJOIN patient p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nJOIN clinical_data_derived cdd ON s.stable_id = cdd.sample_unique_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n  AND cdd.attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'\n  AND cdd.attribute_value = 'Primary'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"primary_sample_count":0}]}
```


Let me check what sample type values are actually available in the study:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT cdd.attribute_value, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM clinical_data_derived cdd\nJOIN sample s ON cdd.sample_unique_id = s.stable_id\nJOIN patient p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n  AND cdd.attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'\nGROUP BY cdd.attribute_value\nORDER BY count DESC\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[]}
```


Let me check the clinical_sample table directly:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT cs_clinical.attr_value, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM clinical_sample cs_clinical\nJOIN sample s ON cs_clinical.internal_id = s.internal_id\nJOIN patient p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n  AND cs_clinical.attr_id = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'\nGROUP BY cs_clinical.attr_value\nORDER BY count DESC\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"attr_value":"Primary","count":15928},{"attr_value":"Metastasis","count":8878},{"attr_value":"Unknown","count":136},{"attr_value":"Local Recurrence","count":98}]}
```


Perfect! Based on the query results, there are **15,928 primary samples** in the MSK-CHORD study (msk_chord_2024).

For context, the study also contains:
- 8,878 metastasis samples
- 136 unknown samples
- 98 local recurrence samples
