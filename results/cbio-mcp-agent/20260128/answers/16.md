# Question 16

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What are the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the clinical data to find this information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    attribute_value AS primary_diagnosis_site,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) AS patient_count\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND attribute_name = 'PRIMARY_SITE'\n    AND attribute_value != ''\nGROUP BY attribute_value\nORDER BY patient_count DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Lung","patient_count":7773},{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Breast","patient_count":5358},{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Prostate","patient_count":3208},{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Pancreas","patient_count":3104},{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Colon","patient_count":2516}]}
```


Based on the MSK-CHORD study data, here are the **top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites**:

1. **Lung** - 7,773 patients
2. **Breast** - 5,358 patients
3. **Prostate** - 3,208 patients
4. **Pancreas** - 3,104 patients
5. **Colon** - 2,516 patients

Lung cancer is the most prevalent primary site in this study, representing nearly 8,000 patients, followed by breast cancer with over 5,000 patients. These five sites together account for a significant portion of the patient population in the MSK-CHORD study.
