# Question 7

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently altered genes in a structural variant in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET.

First, let me search for the TARGET Osteosarcoma study:



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "TARGET Osteosarcoma"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```


Let me try a broader search:



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "Osteosarcoma"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json
[{"cancer_study_identifier":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"os","sample_count":160,"has_guide":true}]
```


Great! I found the study: `os_target_gdc`. Let me get the study guide to understand what data is available:



Calling `get_study_guide` with args:
```json
{
  "study_id": "os_target_gdc"
}
```

# Osteosarcoma (TARGET, 2018)

**Study ID:** `os_target_gdc`

## Overview
Pediatric osteosarcoma study from the TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) initiative. Whole exome sequencing data.

## Gene Panel
- **WES** (Whole Exome Sequencing): All coding genes profiled
- For mutation frequency calculations, you can use study-wide sample counts as the denominator (all genes equally covered)

## Clinical Attributes - Semantic Guide

### Patient Demographics
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `AGE` | Age at diagnosis | In years; pediatric population |
| `SEX` | Patient sex | Male, Female |
| `RACE` | Patient race | Per NIH categories |
| `ETHNICITY` | Patient ethnicity | Hispanic/Latino status |

### Disease Characteristics
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `DISEASE` | Disease type | Should be "Osteosarcoma" |
| `TUMOR_SITE` | Primary tumor location | e.g., Femur, Tibia |
| `HISTOLOGY` | Histological subtype | Osteoblastic, Chondroblastic, etc. |

### Clinical Outcomes
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `OS_MONTHS` | Overall survival in months | Time from diagnosis |
| `OS_STATUS` | Overall survival status | 0:LIVING, 1:DECEASED |
| `EFS_MONTHS` | Event-free survival in months | Time to first event |
| `EFS_STATUS` | Event-free survival status | 0:No event, 1:Event |

### Treatment Response
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `PERCENT_NECROSIS` | Tumor necrosis percentage post-chemotherapy |
| `NECROSIS_GROUP` | Grouped necrosis response |

## Notes & Caveats
- This is a pediatric cancer cohort; age distribution is younger than adult studies
- WES coverage means no gene panel filtering needed for frequency calculations
- Part of TARGET consortium; integrated with other pediatric cancer data

```


Now let me check what structural variant data is available. Let me first look at the genomic_event_derived table to see if structural variants are included:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT variant_type\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\nLIMIT 20\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"variant_type":"cna"},{"variant_type":"mutation"}]}
```


I see that the genomic_event_derived table contains mutations and CNAs, but not structural variants specifically. Let me check if there's a separate structural variant table:



Calling `clickhouse_list_tables` with args:
```json
{}
```

Perfect! I can see there's a `structural_variant` table. Let me check its structure and query for the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants for the TARGET Osteosarcoma study:



Calling `clickhouse_list_table_columns` with args:
```json
{
  "table": "structural_variant"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_list_table_columns`:

```


Now let me query for the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants. Since structural variants involve two sites (site1 and site2), I'll need to count both:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH gene_counts AS (\n  SELECT \n    g.hugo_gene_symbol,\n    g.entrez_gene_id,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sv.sample_id) as sample_count\n  FROM structural_variant sv\n  JOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n  JOIN gene g ON (sv.site1_entrez_gene_id = g.entrez_gene_id OR sv.site2_entrez_gene_id = g.entrez_gene_id)\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND g.entrez_gene_id IS NOT NULL\n  GROUP BY g.hugo_gene_symbol, g.entrez_gene_id\n)\nSELECT \n  hugo_gene_symbol,\n  sample_count,\n  ROUND(sample_count * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.internal_id) \n                                  FROM sample s \n                                  JOIN patient p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id\n                                  JOIN cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n                                  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'), 2) as percentage\nFROM gene_counts\nORDER BY sample_count DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[]}
```


Let me first check if there are any structural variants in this study:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT COUNT(*) as sv_count\nFROM structural_variant sv\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"sv_count":0}]}
```


It appears there are no structural variants in the os_target_gdc study. Let me verify what genetic profiles are available for this study:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n  gp.stable_id,\n  gp.genetic_alteration_type,\n  gp.name,\n  gp.description\nFROM genetic_profile gp\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\nORDER BY gp.genetic_alteration_type\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:

```


I can see that the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc) does not have structural variant data available. The study only contains:
- Mutations (whole exome sequencing)
- Copy number alterations (GISTIC)
- mRNA expression data

Let me check if there are any other osteosarcoma studies with structural variant data:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n  cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n  cs.name,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT sv.internal_id) as sv_count,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT sv.sample_id) as sample_count\nFROM structural_variant sv\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.name LIKE '%Osteosarcoma%' OR cs.name LIKE '%osteosarcoma%'\nGROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\nORDER BY sv_count DESC\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[]}
```


Let me check what studies do have structural variant data:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n  cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n  cs.name,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT sv.internal_id) as sv_count,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT sv.sample_id) as sample_count\nFROM structural_variant sv\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nGROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\nHAVING sv_count > 0\nORDER BY sv_count DESC\nLIMIT 10\n"
}
```

```


I can see that there's a sarcoma study that includes structural variants: "Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma (MSK, Nat Commun 2022)" with study ID `sarcoma_msk_2022`. This might include osteosarcoma samples. Let me check:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT attribute_value as cancer_type\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'sarcoma_msk_2022'\n  AND attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED'\n  AND attribute_value LIKE '%Osteosarcoma%'\nLIMIT 10\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"cancer_type":"Osteosarcoma"},{"cancer_type":"Extraskeletal Osteosarcoma"}]}
```


Great! The MSK Sarcoma study does include osteosarcoma samples. However, the user specifically asked about the "Osteosarcoma study from TARGET", which is the `os_target_gdc` study.

Let me provide a comprehensive answer:

Based on my analysis, **the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc) does not contain structural variant data**. 

The TARGET Osteosarcoma study includes:
- **Mutations** from whole exome sequencing
- **Copy number alterations** (GISTIC)
- **mRNA expression** data

However, structural variant data is not available for this particular study.

If you're interested in structural variants in osteosarcoma, I found that the **MSK Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma study (sarcoma_msk_2022)** does contain structural variant data and includes osteosarcoma samples. Would you like me to analyze the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants for osteosarcoma samples in that study instead?

Alternatively, if you're interested in other types of alterations (mutations or copy number alterations) in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study, I'd be happy to provide that analysis.
