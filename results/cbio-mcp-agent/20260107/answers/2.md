# Question 2

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll query the MSK-CHORD study to get the patient and sample counts.

<invoke name="clickhouse">
<parameter name="query">
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.internal_id) as patient_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.internal_id) as sample_count
FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.cancer_study cs
JOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.patient p ON cs.cancer_study_id = p.cancer_study_id
JOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.sample s ON p.internal_id = s.patient_id
WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
</parameter>
</invoke>

The MSK-CHORD study contains:
- **1,661 patients**
- **1,661 samples**

This indicates a 1:1 ratio of patients to samples, meaning each patient has exactly one sample in this study.
