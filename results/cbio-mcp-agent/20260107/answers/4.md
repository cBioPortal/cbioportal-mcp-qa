# Question 4

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most common treatment received by patients in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the clinical data to identify treatment-related attributes and their values.

<clickhouse_query>
SELECT attr_id, description, patient_attribute
FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.clinical_attribute_meta 
WHERE cancer_study_id = (
    SELECT cancer_study_id 
    FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.cancer_study 
    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
)
AND (LOWER(description) LIKE '%treatment%' OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%therapy%' OR LOWER(attr_id) LIKE '%treatment%' OR LOWER(attr_id) LIKE '%therapy%')
ORDER BY attr_id;
</clickhouse_query>

Now let me look for treatment-related data in the clinical data:

<clickhouse_query>
SELECT attribute_name, COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count
FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
AND (LOWER(attribute_name) LIKE '%treatment%' OR LOWER(attribute_name) LIKE '%therapy%')
GROUP BY attribute_name
ORDER BY patient_count DESC;
</clickhouse_query>

Let me check what clinical attributes are available that might relate to treatments:

<clickhouse_query>
SELECT DISTINCT attribute_name
FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
AND attribute_name IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY attribute_name;
</clickhouse_query>

Now let me look for specific treatment-related attributes that might be present:

<clickhouse_query>
SELECT attribute_name, attribute_value, COUNT(*) as count
FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
AND (
    attribute_name LIKE '%TREATMENT%' OR 
    attribute_name LIKE '%THERAPY%' OR
    attribute_name LIKE '%DRUG%' OR
    attribute_name LIKE '%REGIMEN%'
)
GROUP BY attribute_name, attribute_value
ORDER BY attribute_name, count DESC;
</clickhouse_query>

Let me check if there are any clinical events that might contain treatment information:

<clickhouse_query>
SELECT DISTINCT event_type, COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.clinical_event ce
JOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.patient p ON ce.patient_id = p.internal_id
JOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id
WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
</clickhouse_query>

Let me also check if there are any sample-level treatment attributes:

<clickhouse_query>
SELECT cs.attr_id, COUNT(*) as sample_count, 
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cs.attr_value, ', ') as sample_values
FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.clinical_sample cs
JOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.sample s ON cs.internal_id = s.internal_id
JOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.patient p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id
JOIN cgds_public_2025_06_24.cancer_study study ON p.cancer_study_id = study.cancer_study_id
WHERE study.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
AND (LOWER(cs.attr_id) LIKE '%treatment%' OR LOWER(cs.attr_id) LIKE '%therapy%' OR LOWER(cs.attr_id) LIKE '%drug%')
GROUP BY cs.attr_id
ORDER BY sample_count DESC;
</clickhouse_query>

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD study data, I was unable to find specific treatment information in
