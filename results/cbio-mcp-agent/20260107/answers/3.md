# Question 3

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the number of primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the database to get this information.

<invoke name="clickhouse">
<parameter name="query">
SELECT COUNT(*) as primary_sample_count
FROM cgds_public_2025_06_24.clinical_data_derived 
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024' 
  AND attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE' 
  AND attribute_value = 'Primary'
</parameter>
</invoke>

The MSK-CHORD study contains **1,444 primary samples**.

This count represents samples that are specifically classified as "Primary" in the sample type clinical attribute, which typically indicates samples taken directly from the primary tumor site rather than metastatic sites or other sample types.
