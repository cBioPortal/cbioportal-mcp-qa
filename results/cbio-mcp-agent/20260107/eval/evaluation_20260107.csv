How many studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM output states there are 1,449 studies, but the expected answer is 492 studies. This is a significant discrepancy and factually incorrect.",3.0,The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of studies in cBioPortal and includes the methodology (SQL query) used to obtain this information.,2,"The core answer is direct, but includes some unnecessary elaboration about the studies representing 'a comprehensive collection of cancer genomics datasets from various research institutions and consortiums worldwide' which wasn't asked for.",3,"The LLM output relies on querying the cBioPortal database as specified in the context/source, using a SQL query to extract the information directly from the database."
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM output reports 1,661 patients and 1,661 samples, which is completely incorrect compared to the expected answer of 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples. The numbers are drastically different.",3.0,"The output fully addresses the question by providing both patient and sample counts as requested, and even adds context about the 1:1 ratio.",3,"The answer is direct and to the point, providing the requested information clearly without unnecessary verbosity (excluding the SQL query and metadata as instructed).",3,"The LLM output relies on querying the cbioportal database as specified in the context/source, using a SQL query to extract the information rather than hallucinating or using external knowledge."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM output states there are 1,444 primary samples, but the expected answer is 15,928 primary samples. This is a significant discrepancy and factually incorrect.",3.0,The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of primary samples and includes additional context about what primary samples represent.,2,"The answer is mostly concise but includes some unnecessary explanatory text about what primary samples typically indicate, which goes beyond what was asked.",3,"The LLM output relies on querying the specified cbioportal database source and doesn't introduce external information or hallucinations. The methodology is faithful to the context, even though the result appears incorrect."
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM output does not provide the correct answer. The expected answer is 'Fluorouracil', but the LLM was unable to find or identify this treatment information in the database queries.",1.0,"The output completely fails to answer the question. Despite running multiple database queries, it concludes with 'I was unable to find specific treatment information' and provides no answer about what treatment most patients received.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, running six different database queries and providing extensive technical details about the search process, but ultimately failing to provide any answer to the simple question asked.",3,The LLM output relies entirely on the provided database context and does not introduce any external information or hallucinations. It honestly reports its inability to find the information in the database.
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,3,"The LLM output provides completely different genes and frequencies compared to the expected answer. Expected: TP53 22.4%, MUC16 11.2%, TTN 11.2%, ATRX 7.7%, DNAH9 7.0%. Actual: TP53 50.0%, RB1 33.0%, ATRX 13.6%, DLG2 9.1%, RECQL4 8.0%. Only TP53 and ATRX overlap, but with vastly different frequencies.",,"The LLM output fully addresses the question by providing the top 5 most frequently mutated genes with their mutation frequencies in a clear, structured format including percentages and sample counts.",2,"The output is well-structured with a clear table and summary, but includes some additional details like sample counts and methodology that, while informative, make it somewhat verbose beyond what was strictly asked.",3,"The LLM output relies entirely on database queries from the cbioportal database as specified in the context. All information is derived from the SQL queries executed against the database, with no external knowledge or hallucinations evident."
