How many studies are in cBioPortal?,2,"The output correctly directs to the datasets page where study counts can be found and accurately describes what information is available there. However, it doesn't provide a specific number, which the question asks for. The statement that 'the exact number varies' is accurate but doesn't fully answer the direct question.",2,"The output provides the correct URL and explains how to find the information, but doesn't directly answer the question with a specific number. While it's true the number changes over time, the question asks 'how many' which typically expects a numerical answer or at least an attempt to provide the current count.",2,"The output provides useful context about what can be found on the datasets page, but includes somewhat excessive detail about filtering options and table features that weren't requested. A more concise answer would focus on directing to the URL and noting where the count is displayed.",3,The output faithfully references the expected answer source (https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets) and doesn't introduce information that couldn't be verified from the cBioPortal database. All statements about what's available on the datasets page are reasonable descriptions of what such a page would contain.,538,135,4.262970305047929
How many glioblastoma studies are in cBioPortal?,2,"The LLM Output provides accurate information about how to find glioblastoma studies on cBioPortal (using the search box on the homepage), but it does not provide the actual number of studies, which is what the question asks for. The expected answer includes the datasets page URL which would show the count.",1,"The output does not answer the specific question asked. The user wants to know 'how many' studies exist, expecting a numerical answer, but the LLM only provides instructions on how to find this information themselves. The expected answer points to the datasets page where the actual count would be visible.",2,The output provides reasonable instructions but could be more direct. It includes some unnecessary explanation about the interface when the question simply asks for a count. A more concise answer would either provide the number directly or simply link to the datasets page.,3,The output relies on information that would be available from the cBioPortal database (the context/source). It correctly references the cBioPortal homepage and describes legitimate functionality of the platform without introducing hallucinated information.,543,92,3.051839069928974
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output provides an incorrect URL (chord_msk_2022) when the Expected Answer shows the correct URL should be (msk_chord_2024). This is a factual error in the study identifier, which is critical for accessing the correct information.",1,"The LLM Output does not provide the actual numbers of patients and samples, which is what the question explicitly asks for. Instead, it only directs the user to a page where they could find this information themselves, without answering the question.",2,"The output includes some unnecessary details about what can be found on the study summary page (sample breakdown, clinical data availability, molecular profiling information) when the question only asks for patient and sample counts. However, it's not excessively verbose.",1,"The LLM appears to have hallucinated or used external knowledge to construct a URL that differs from the Expected Answer provided in the Context/Source. The study ID 'chord_msk_2022' does not match the correct 'msk_chord_2024' from the expected answer, suggesting the model generated information not faithful to the source.",542,129,3.399886586004868
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output provides an incorrect URL (chord_msk_2022) when the expected answer shows the correct URL should be msk_chord_2024. This is a factual error in the study identifier, which is critical for accessing the correct information.",1,"The output does not answer the question at all. It only provides a URL and instructions on where to find the information, rather than stating the actual number of primary samples in the MSK-CHORD Study.",1,"The output is excessively verbose for what should be a simple numerical answer. It includes unnecessary explanations about what can be found on the summary page, formatting with headers and bullet points, and extensive metadata that doesn't contribute to answering the question.",1,"The LLM appears to have hallucinated or used external knowledge to construct the URL with the wrong study identifier (chord_msk_2022 instead of msk_chord_2024). The context indicates cbioportal database as the source, but the LLM generated an incorrect study ID that doesn't match the expected answer.",541,152,3.799576151999645
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output provides an incorrect URL (chord_msk_2022) compared to the expected answer (msk_chord_2024). The study identifier is wrong, which means the user would be directed to the wrong study or a non-existent page.",1,"The output does not answer the question about what treatment most patients received. Instead, it only provides navigation instructions to find the answer. The question asks for a specific treatment, but the LLM provides a process rather than the actual answer.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing detailed step-by-step navigation instructions when the question simply asks for what treatment most patients received. The response includes unnecessary explanatory text about how to use the interface rather than directly answering the question.",2,"While the LLM attempts to stay faithful to the cbioportal database context, it generates a specific URL that doesn't match the expected answer, suggesting it may have hallucinated or incorrectly inferred the study identifier. The general approach of directing to clinical data is reasonable, but the specific study ID appears to be incorrect.",542,171,4.8363606000784785
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM provides a URL to a cBioPortal page, but the URL points to a different study ('ost_target_2018_pub') than the expected answer ('os_target_gdc'). While the approach of navigating to the Mutations tab is correct, the specific study identifier appears to be incorrect or at least different from what was expected.",2,The LLM provides instructions on how to find the answer (navigate to Mutations tab and view the ranked table) but does not actually list the top 5 genes themselves. The answer is procedural rather than providing the specific gene names requested in the question.,2,The response includes helpful navigation instructions but is somewhat verbose with explanatory text about what the user will see. A more concise answer would either directly list the top 5 genes or provide a shorter path to finding them.,3,"The LLM's response is consistent with using cBioPortal as the source database and provides a legitimate cBioPortal URL structure. The approach described (checking the Mutations tab for ranked gene frequencies) is a valid method within cBioPortal, showing faithfulness to the specified context/source.",551,264,7.2849113100674
