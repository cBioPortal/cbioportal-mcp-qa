"What are the survival differences between EGFR-mutated, EGFR-amplified, and EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients?",2.0,"The LLM Output provides a URL to cBioPortal, but it is NOT the correct URL. The expected answer shows a specific comparison/survival URL with three distinct groups (EGFR:MUT, EGFR:AMP, and Unaltered), while the LLM provides a different URL that goes to a general comparison page without the pre-configured survival groups. The instructions about navigating to the Survival tab are correct in principle, but the URL itself doesn't directly answer the question as expected.",2.0,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing a cBioPortal URL and explaining how to view survival data, but it doesn't provide the direct link to the survival comparison that was expected.

The LLM fails to provide any actual data or findings about the prognostic significance of MGMT methylation.",1.0,"The output is excessively verbose, providing lengthy instructions on how to navigate the cBioPortal interface, multiple bullet points about what can be explored, and step-by-step guidance. For a question asking about a specific biological relationship, the answer should be more direct rather than a tutorial on using the platform.",2.0,"While the LLM attempts to use cBioPortal as the source, it provides a different URL than the expected answer and makes assumptions about what data might be available and how to access it. The instructions about exploring methylation data and survival outcomes are generic platform guidance rather than information directly from the provided context. The expected answer suggests there is a specific survival comparison already available, which the LLM does not reference.",556,433,8.845842665992677,,
For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,3.0,"The LLM correctly identifies that this question is out of scope for cBioPortal. It accurately states that cBioPortal does not contain quality of life data or information about secondary cancer development, and correctly describes what data IS available (genomic alterations, survival outcomes, molecular profiles).",3.0,"The output fully addresses the question by clearly explaining why it cannot be answered using cBioPortal, what limitations exist, what alternative data can be explored, and where the user should look instead (primary literature or clinical trial databases). It provides a comprehensive explanation of the scope mismatch.",2.0,"While the answer is well-structured and informative, it could be more concise. The detailed breakdown of 'What you CAN explore' and 'What is NOT available' with multiple bullet points, while helpful, makes the response somewhat verbose for what is essentially an 'out of scope' determination.",3.0,The output is faithful to the cBioPortal database context. It accurately describes the capabilities and limitations of cBioPortal without introducing external information or hallucinations. The statement about what data is and isn't available in cBioPortal is consistent with the database's known scope and functionality.,564,479,11.443334519979544,,
"In the ""Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes"" study what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?",1.0,"The LLM Output provides a URL to a general results page rather than the specific comparison page shown in the Expected Answer. The Expected Answer URL (comparison/survival?comparisonId=691f3fd9b2bb32147b013ee9) points to a pre-configured comparison with specific survival statistics, while the LLM's URL goes to a generic results page that requires manual configuration. The LLM does not provide the actual survival difference or statistical significance values that the question asks for.",1.0,"The answer is incomplete as it does not provide the actual survival difference (e.g., median survival times) or the statistical significance (p-value) between the two patient groups. Instead, it only directs the user to a page where they would need to manually configure and extract this information themselves. The question explicitly asks for specific numerical values that are not provided.",2.0,"While the response provides some useful guidance on what the user will see and how to use the interface, it is somewhat verbose given that it doesn't actually answer the question. The explanation of features and controls is helpful but takes up space without delivering the requested data. A more concise response would either provide the actual values or more directly state that manual configuration is needed.",3.0,"The LLM Output appears to rely on knowledge of the cbioportal database structure and interface, which is consistent with the stated Context/Source.

Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,1.0,"The expected answer is 'Out of scope', indicating this question should not be answered using cBioPortal. However, the LLM attempted to provide a detailed answer about finding such studies in cBioPortal, which is incorrect. The LLM should have recognized this as out of scope and declined to answer or redirected the user appropriately.",1.0,"The LLM failed to recognize that this question is out of scope for cBioPortal. Instead of acknowledging this limitation, it provided extensive guidance on how to search for studies, which does not address the fundamental issue that this type of detailed RNA-seq methodology information is not the primary focus of cBioPortal's capabilities.",1.0,"The output is excessively verbose for a question that should have been marked as out of scope. It includes multiple tool calls, extensive thinking processes, detailed instructions, and explanations that are unnecessary given that the expected answer is simply 'Out of scope'.",2.0,"While the LLM correctly notes that 'cBioPortal doesn't have a direct filter for RNA-seq library preparation method' and acknowledges limitations in the metadata, it still attempts to provide guidance based on assumptions about what might be available in cBioPortal. The response includes some faithful observations about cBioPortal's limitations but goes beyond what can be verified from the context by suggesting specific search strategies that may not be effective.",550,767,13.631419381010346,,
In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?,1.0,"The LLM Output provides an incorrect URL that does not lead to the comparison/mRNA results page shown in the Expected Answer. The provided URL points to a plots tab with incorrect parameters (brca_tcga instead of brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018, and wrong genetic profile IDs). The Expected Answer URL directly shows the mRNA comparison results, while the LLM's URL requires multiple manual steps that may not even lead to the correct analysis.",1.0,"The LLM Output does not provide the actual top 5 down-regulated genes, which is what the question asks for. Instead, it provides instructions on how to potentially find this information through multiple navigation steps. The Expected Answer URL directly displays the comparison results with the down-regulated genes, but the LLM fails to provide either the direct link or the actual gene names.",1.0,"The output is excessively verbose, providing lengthy step-by-step instructions and alternative approaches when the question simply asks for the top 5 down-regulated genes. The Expected Answer demonstrates that a direct URL to the comparison results would be sufficient, making the LLM's multi-step navigation guide unnecessarily complex.",2.0,"While the LLM attempts to use cBioPortal as the source, it generates a URL and navigation instructions that don't accurately reflect the Expected Answer's approach. The study ID used (brca_tcga) differs from the correct one (brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018), and the suggested workflow doesn't match the direct comparison/mRNA endpoint shown in the Expected Answer. This suggests some reliance on general knowledge about cBioPortal rather than faithfully reproducing the specific source information.",569,384,7.709920655936003,,
In the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients who were older than four when diagnosed and the younger ones?,2.0,"The LLM provides a URL that attempts to answer the question, but the URL structure differs from the expected answer. The expected answer points to a direct comparison page (comparison/survival?comparisonId=...), while the LLM output provides a results/comparison URL with encoded parameters. While the approach is conceptually correct (comparing age groups in the TARGET neuroblastoma study), the specific URL implementation may not work as intended or may not match the exact comparison requested.",2.0,The LLM Output provides guidance on where to find the survival difference and statistical significance but does not provide the actual numerical values for the survival difference or p-value. It directs the user to view the information rather than stating it directly. The answer is partially complete as it explains what the user will see but doesn't answer the specific quantitative question asked.,2.0,"The response includes helpful context about what the user will see on the page, but it's somewhat verbose with bullet points explaining the interface features. The core answer could be more direct. The inclusion of model information and metadata at the end adds unnecessary length, though per instructions this should be ignored in evaluation.",3.0,"The LLM Output relies on knowledge of the cbioportal database structure and the TARGET Pediatric Neuroblastoma study, which is consistent with the specified context/source.

In the TCGA Glioblastoma multiforme study compare the median patient age at diagnosis between patients with IDH1 R132H mutation and patients with wild-type IDH1.,2.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the need to compare IDH1 R132H mutant vs wild-type patients and mentions the correct clinical attribute (Diagnosis Age). However, the provided URL is a sessionId-based link that may not be permanent or accessible, and it references 'Firehose Legacy' study rather than the 'pan_can_atlas_2018' study shown in the expected answer. The expected answer uses a specific comparison URL format with proper parameters.",2.0,"The output provides a URL and explains what should be visible on the comparison page, but it doesn't actually provide the median age values for the two groups, which is what the question asks for. It only directs the user to where they can find this information. A complete answer would include the actual median ages or at least acknowledge that the user needs to view the page to see the specific values.",2.0,"The output includes helpful context about what the comparison page will show, but it's somewhat verbose with bullet points explaining features of the page. The extensive model information section at the end adds unnecessary length, though per instructions this metadata should be ignored. The core answer could be more direct.",3.0,"The output relies on knowledge of cBioPortal's functionality and structure, which is appropriate given the context/source is the cbioportal database. The LLM doesn't introduce information that contradicts or goes beyond what would be expected from querying cBioPortal for this comparison.",570,245,6.148457775940187,,
"In breast cancer, what is the correlation coefficient between EGFR expression levels and PIK3CA mutation status considering only patients who also have a homozygous deletion of PTEN?",1.0,"The LLM provided a URL that does not correctly answer the question. The expected answer URL shows a properly configured plot with EGFR mRNA expression on the horizontal axis, PIK3CA mutation on the vertical axis, and a filter applied for PTEN homozygous deletions. The LLM's URL has incorrect axis configurations (PIK3CA on horizontal, EGFR on vertical) and does not include the critical PTEN homozygous deletion filter in the URL parameters. The LLM mentions applying the filter manually, but this means the URL itself doesn't directly answer the question.",1.0,"The answer is incomplete because it does not provide the actual correlation coefficient value. Instead, it provides a URL that requires additional manual steps (applying PTEN filter) to get to the answer. The expected answer URL directly shows the filtered data, while the LLM's answer requires the user to perform additional filtering steps themselves.",2.0,The output provides reasonable instructions but includes unnecessary details about what the Plots tab allows in general. The step-by-step instructions are helpful but could be more direct. The model information section is standard metadata and not evaluated for conciseness.,3.0,"The LLM Output relies on knowledge of cBioPortal functionality and structure, which is appropriate given the context specifies cBioPortal as the source.
