I've routed you to the Clinical Data tab of the MSK-CHORD Study (Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer). On this page, you can:

1. View the clinical attributes table showing all available patient characteristics
2. Look for treatment-related variables (such as "Treatment Type," "Prior Therapy," or similar fields)
