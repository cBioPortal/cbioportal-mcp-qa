# Question 16

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many unique patients have both primary and metastatic samples in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you navigate to the cBioPortal page where you can analyze the MSK-CHORD Study to answer your question about patients with both primary and metastatic samples.

**URL**: https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=chord_msk_2024

This URL takes you to the **Study Summary page** for the MSK-CHORD Study. 

On this page, you'll find:
- **Clinical Data tab**: Where you can explore sample-level and patient-level clinical attributes, including sample type (primary vs. metastatic)
- **Sample counts**: Information about the total number of samples and patients in the study
- You can filter and analyze the clinical data to identify patients who have both primary and metastatic samples by examining the sample type annotations

To specifically answer your question, you would need to:
1. Navigate to the Clinical Data section
2. Look at the "Sample Type" or similar clinical attribute
3. Group by patient ID to identify which patients have multiple samples with different types (primary and metastatic)

The Study Summary page provides the tools to explore this data yourself and determine the exact count of patients meeting your criteria.
