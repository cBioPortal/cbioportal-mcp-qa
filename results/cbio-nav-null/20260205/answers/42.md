# Question 42

**Type:** Co-occurring Mutations

**Question:** What percentage of endometrial cancer patients have co-occurring oncogenic mutations in both KRAS and NRAS?

I've routed you to the OncoPrint view for the TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018 Endometrial Cancer study (UCEC) with KRAS and NRAS queried.

On this page, you'll see:
- A visual matrix showing mutation and copy number alteration patterns for KRAS and NRAS across all patients
- The alteration frequency for each gene displayed above the OncoPrint
- Patient samples arranged in columns, with genes in rows
- A summary showing how many patients have alterations in each gene and co-occurring alterations

To find the co-occurrence percentage:
1. Look at the OncoPrint visualization to see which samples have alterations in both genes
2. Check the "Mutual Exclusivity" tab to see statistical analysis of co-occurrence vs. mutual exclusivity
3. Use the "Cancer Types Summary" or download the data for precise calculations

The visualization will show you the overlap pattern, allowing you to determine what percentage of patients have oncogenic mutations in both KRAS and NRAS simultaneously.
