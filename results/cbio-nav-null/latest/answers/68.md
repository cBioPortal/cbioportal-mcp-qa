# Question 68

**Type:** Cross-Cohort Comparison

**Question:** What are the key genomic differences between lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas identified in the Pan-Lung Cancer TCGA study?

**Answer:**

**URL**: http://www.cbioportal.org/comparison?comparisonId=64e0e4e8498eb8b2e3061e1e

I've routed you to a **Comparison Page** in cBioPortal that compares lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) from the TCGA Pan-Lung Cancer study.

On this page, you can explore the genomic differences yourself through several tabs:

- **Overview**: Summary statistics and sample counts for each group
- **Mutations**: Compare mutation frequencies between LUAD and LUSC, including significantly different genes
- **CNA (Copy Number Alterations)**: Identify differences in amplifications and deletions
- **mRNA**: Compare gene expression patterns between the two subtypes
- **Protein**: Examine protein-level differences (if available)
- **Survival**: Compare clinical outcomes between groups

The visualizations will show you which genes are significantly altered differently between these two lung cancer subtypes, allowing you to identify the key genomic distinctions yourself.
