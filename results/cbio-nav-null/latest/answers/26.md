# Question 26

**Type:** Gene Panels

**Question:** What percentage of genomic events in the MSK-CHORD Study occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used)?

To answer your question about the percentage of genomic events occurring in off-panel genes in the MSK-CHORD Study, navigate to the URL above.

Once there, you can explore the genomic alterations data to identify which events fall outside the sequencing panel coverage. The study page will show you:

- **Summary statistics** of genomic alterations detected
- **Mutation and CNA data** across samples
- Access to the **OncoPrint** and other visualization tools where you can examine which genes harbor alterations

To specifically identify off-panel events, you'll need to:
1. Review the study's methodology/documentation (often linked on the study page) to understand which genes were on the sequencing panel
2. Compare the genes with detected alterations against the panel gene list
3. Calculate the proportion of events in genes not covered by the panel

The study summary page is your starting point for accessing all the molecular profiling data needed to perform this analysis.
