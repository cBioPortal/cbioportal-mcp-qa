# Question 25

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Comparison

**Question:** How does the mutation landscape differ between primary and metastatic samples from the same patients in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

**URL**: https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=chord_msk_2024

To explore how the mutation landscape differs between primary and metastatic samples from the same patients in the MSK-CHORD Study, navigate to the URL above.

On the **Study Summary page**, you'll find:
- Sample composition showing primary vs. metastatic samples
- Overview of genomic alterations across the cohort

To analyze mutation differences between matched primary-metastatic pairs:

1. **Navigate to the "Clinical Data" tab** to identify patients with both primary and metastatic samples
2. **Use the "Plots" tab** to create custom visualizations comparing mutation counts or specific gene alterations between sample types
3. **Query specific genes** using the study query interface, then filter by sample type (primary vs. metastatic) to compare alteration frequencies
4. **Use the "Comparison/Survival" features** to stratify by sample type and examine mutation patterns

The study page will allow you to interactively explore these differences through cBioPortal's visualization tools rather than providing a pre-computed comparison.
