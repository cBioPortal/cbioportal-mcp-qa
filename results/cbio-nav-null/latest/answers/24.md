# Question 24

**Type:** Treatment Response

**Question:** Which genomic alterations are associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

**URL**: https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=chord_msk_2024

I've routed you to the MSK-CHORD Study (Comprehensive Harmonization of Oncology Real-world Data), which includes melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy.

To explore genomic alterations associated with immunotherapy response, you can:

1. **Clinical Data Tab**: Filter patients by melanoma diagnosis and immunotherapy treatment status to identify responders vs. non-responders
2. **Plots Tab**: Create custom plots comparing genomic alterations (mutation counts, specific gene mutations, copy number alterations) against clinical response metrics
3. **Comparison/Survival Tab**: Compare genomic profiles between patient groups with different treatment outcomes
4. **OncoPrint**: Visualize mutation patterns across patients, potentially grouped by response status

The study page will allow you to analyze which specific genes, mutation types, or genomic features correlate with immunotherapy response in this real-world melanoma cohort.
