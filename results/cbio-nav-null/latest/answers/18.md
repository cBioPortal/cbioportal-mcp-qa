**Answer:**

**URL**: https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=chord_msk_2024

This question asks about treatment regimens, which is clinical data that may be available in the MSK-CHORD study. I've routed you to the study summary page.

To explore systemic therapy data:

1. **Check the "Clinical Data" tab** on the study page to see if treatment/therapy information is available as a clinical attribute
2. If treatment data exists, you can:
   - View it in the **Clinical Data table** to see individual patient regimens
   - Use the **Plots tab** (after selecting all samples) to create visualizations of treatment frequencies
   - Use **Charts** to see distributions of therapy types

**Note**: Not all studies include detailed treatment regimen data. If this information isn't available in MSK-CHORD, you would need to consult the original publication or contact the study authors directly, as cBioPortal primarily focuses on genomic and molecular data rather than detailed treatment protocols.
