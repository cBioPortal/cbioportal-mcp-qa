# Question 59

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find studies that used RNA sequencing methods suitable for lncRNA analysis (i.e., not polyA-enriched).

Let me search for studies with RNA-seq data and check their processing methods.

<think>
The user is asking about studies that didn't use polyA enrichment, which would be better for lncRNA analysis since many lncRNAs lack polyA tails. This is a navigation question - I need to help them find appropriate studies in cBioPortal.

I should:
1. First search for studies with RNA-seq data
2. Look for information about RNA-seq library preparation methods
3. Identify studies that used total RNA or rRNA depletion rather than polyA selection

Let me start by searching for studies and their molecular profiles.

<attempt_mcp_tool_call>
<tool_name>searchStudiesTool</tool_name>
<parameters>
<keyword>RNA-seq</keyword>
</parameters>
</attempt_mcp_tool_call>

<think>
I need to search more broadly and then check molecular profile details. Let me try getting all studies first and then filter for those with RNA-seq data, checking their descriptions for library preparation methods.
</think>

<attempt_mcp_tool_call>
<tool_name>searchStudiesTool</tool_name>
<parameters>
<keyword>total RNA</keyword>
</parameters>
</attempt_mcp_tool_call>

<think>
The search might not find studies by library prep method directly. Let me try a different approach - I should look for studies that explicitly mention rRNA depletion or total RNA in their descriptions, or I could navigate to a study list page where users can explore study details themselves.

Actually, the best approach is to route the user to a page where they can explore studies and their molecular profiling details. The study list page would be most appropriate.

**URL**: https://www.cbioportal.org/

To find studies suitable for lncRNA analysis (those not using polyA enrichment), you'll need to:

1. **Navigate to the study list** using the URL above
2. **Filter for studies with RNA-seq data** by looking at the molecular profiles column
3. **Check individual study descriptions** for library preparation methods - look for terms like:
   - "rRNA depletion"
   - "total RNA"
   - "ribosomal RNA depletion"
   - Avoid studies mentioning "polyA selection" or "polyA enrichment"

**Note**: cBioPortal's study metadata doesn't always include detailed library preparation protocols in searchable fields. You may need to:
- Click into individual studies to read their descriptions
- Check the original publication references linked in each study
- Look for studies from consortia that typically use total RNA methods (some TCGA studies used rRNA depletion)

Unfortunately, cBioPortal doesn't have a direct filter for RNA-seq library preparation method, so manual review of study descriptions and linked publications will be necessary to identify the most appropriate datasets for lncRNA analysis.
