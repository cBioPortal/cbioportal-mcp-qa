How many studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM Output does not provide the correct answer. The expected answer is 516 studies, but the LLM states it doesn't have a direct tool to count studies and only mentions 'hundreds of cancer studies' without providing a specific number.",1,"The output fails to answer the specific question asked. The user wanted a numerical count of studies (516), but the LLM redirected to a webpage and provided general information about study types instead of delivering the requested count.",1,"The output is excessively verbose for a simple numerical question. It includes unnecessary information about study types, institutions, and offers to help with related searches when the user only asked for a count. A simple '516 studies' would have been appropriate.",2,"While the LLM correctly states it's working with the cBioPortal database context, it fails to extract the available information (the count of 516 studies). The general information about TCGA, ICGC, and other study types appears to be based on general knowledge rather than the specific context provided, though it's not entirely fabricated.",21145,288,7.154717650031671
How many glioblastoma studies are in cBioPortal?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies that there are 7 glioblastoma studies in cBioPortal, which matches the expected answer. The tool call result explicitly states 'totalCount':7 and lists all 7 study IDs.",3,"The output fully addresses the question by providing the exact count (7 studies) and goes beyond by listing all studies with their names and sample counts, giving the user comprehensive information.",2,"While the output correctly answers the question in the first sentence, it then provides extensive additional details about each study (sample counts, categorization into TCGA vs other studies, and recommendations) that weren't requested. The core answer could have been more direct.",3,"All information in the output is directly traceable to the tool call result from the cBioPortal database. The study names, sample counts, and total count of 7 studies all come from the provided context with no external information or hallucinations.",45761,407,9.103138322010636
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM Output correctly identifies the sample count as 25,040 samples, which matches the expected answer. However, it does not explicitly state the patient count of 24,950, only mentioning that the patient count is 'typically shown in the study summary' without providing the actual number.",2,"The answer is partially complete. It provides the sample count (25,040) but fails to explicitly state the patient count (24,950), which is a key part of the question. The LLM suggests viewing the study page to find the patient count rather than providing it directly.",2,"The output is somewhat verbose. While it provides useful context about the study, it includes unnecessary details such as the list of what will be shown on the study page, the publication information, and cancer types covered. A more concise answer would simply state both the patient and sample counts directly.",3,"The LLM Output relies entirely on the information retrieved from the cBioPortal database through the tool calls. The sample count of 25,040 is directly extracted from the API response, and all other information (study name, molecular profiles, etc.) comes from the provided context. No external information or hallucinations are present.",65014,398,11.835298515041359
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output does not provide the actual number of primary samples (15,928). Instead, it only mentions the total sample count of 25,040 and directs the user to a filtered view to find the answer themselves. This fails to answer the specific question asked.",1,"The answer is incomplete. While the LLM successfully navigated to the study and attempted to filter for primary samples, it did not retrieve or report the actual count of 15,928 primary samples. It only provided a link for the user to check themselves, which does not constitute a complete answer to the direct question.",2,"The output includes unnecessary details about the navigation process and tool calls. While some context is helpful, the response could have been more direct. The main issue is not verbosity but rather the failure to provide the actual answer, instead redirecting the user to find it themselves.",3,"The LLM Output relies entirely on the cBioPortal database context provided through the tool calls. It correctly identifies the study (msk_chord_2024), uses the SAMPLE_TYPE attribute, and references only information retrieved from the database. No external information or hallucinations are present.",110001,703,19.069734122953378
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output does not provide the correct answer. The expected answer is 'Fluorouracil', but the LLM does not identify or mention this treatment at all. Instead, it only provides navigation instructions without actually answering the question.",1,"The LLM Output fails to answer the question. It navigates to the study page and provides instructions on how to find treatment information, but does not actually identify what treatment most patients received. The answer is completely missing.",1,"The output is excessively verbose. It includes unnecessary navigation steps, detailed instructions for exploring the study view, and explanatory text about the study characteristics, when the question simply asks for the most common treatment. A concise answer would have been a single word or short phrase: 'Fluorouracil'.",2,"While the LLM correctly uses the cbioportal database context to navigate to the study, it makes assumptions about what users can find on the page without actually retrieving or presenting the treatment data. The statement about 'Treatment data availability and detail will depend on what was collected' is speculative rather than based on the actual data that should be available in the context.",65011,428,12.606987445964478
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,1,"The LLM Output does not provide the actual answer with the specific genes and their mutation frequencies. The expected answer shows TP53 (22.4%), MUC16 (11.2%), TTN (11.2%), ATRX (7.7%), and DNAH9 (7.0%), but the LLM only provides a link to the study page without extracting or displaying this information.",1,"The answer is incomplete. While the LLM successfully navigated to the correct study page, it failed to retrieve and present the top 5 most frequently mutated genes with their percentages. Instead, it only provided instructions on where to find this information on the webpage, leaving the user to manually extract the data.",2,"The output includes some unnecessary details such as the full study metadata, clinical attribute IDs, and molecular profile IDs. While the navigation steps are relevant, the response could have been more direct by either extracting the mutation data or clearly stating that the tool cannot retrieve this specific information.",3,"The LLM Output is faithful to the cbioportal database context. It correctly identifies the study, uses the appropriate tools to navigate to the study page, and references the mutation data that would be available on that page. It does not introduce information from outside sources or hallucinate data.",64829,465,12.860393562004901
