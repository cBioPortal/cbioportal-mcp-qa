# Question 68

**Type:** Cross-Cohort Comparison

**Question:** What are the key genomic differences between lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas identified in the Pan-Lung Cancer TCGA study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the genomic differences between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas. Let me start by finding the relevant studies.

Perfect! I found both lung cancer studies from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas:

1. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** - 566 samples
2. **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)** - 487 samples

To explore the genomic differences between these two histological subtypes, I'll provide you with direct links to both studies. You can then use cBioPortal's built-in comparison tools to identify key differences:

## Direct Study Links:

**Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas):**
https://www.cbioportal.org/study?id=luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018

**Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas):**
https://www.cbioportal.org/study?id=lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018

## Key Known Genomic Differences:

Based on published TCGA data, here are the major genomic distinctions between these subtypes:

### **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) - Characteristic Alterations:**
- **EGFR mutations** (~15-20%) - rare in squamous
- **KRAS mutations** (~30%) - much less common in squamous
- **ALK fusions** (~5%) - virtually absent in squamous
- **ROS1 fusions** (~1-2%) - rare in squamous
- **STK11/LKB1 mutations** (~20%)
- **KEAP1 mutations** (~15-20%)

### **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) - Characteristic Alterations:**
- **TP53 mutations** (~80-90%) - higher than adenocarcinoma
- **CDKN2A deletions** (~70%)
- **SOX2 amplifications** (~20-30%)
- **PIK3CA mutations** (~15-20%) - more common than in adenocarcinoma
- **PTEN loss** - more frequent
- **FGFR1 amplifications** (~20%)
- **DDR2 mutations** (~3-5%)

### **Shared Alterations (but different frequencies):**
- **TP53 mutations** - present in both but higher in squamous
- **MLL2/KMT2D mutations**
- **NF1 mutations**

## How to Compare in cBioPortal:

You can perform a cross-study comparison by:
1. Querying both studies together with key genes
2. Using the "Cancer Types Summary" to see mutation frequency differences
3. Comparing copy number alterations between the two cohorts

Would you like me to generate a specific comparison view (e.g., an OncoPrint comparing specific genes across both studies)?
