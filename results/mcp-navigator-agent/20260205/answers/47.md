# Question 47

**Type:** Cross-Study Expression Comparison

**Question:** How does ERBB2 mRNA expression vary across different cancer types in TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore ERBB2 mRNA expression across different cancer types in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies.

Let me start by finding the appropriate Pan-Cancer Atlas study:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "TCGA",
    "pan-cancer",
    "atlas"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"Service Unavailable","details":{"status":503,"response":{"req":{"method":"GET","url":"https://www.cbioportal.org/api/column-store/studies","headers":{"user-agent":"node-superagent/3.8.3","accept":"application/json"}},"header":{"date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:48:21 GMT","content-type":"text/html","content-length":"190","connection":"close","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"},"status":503,"text":"<html>\r\n<head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"}}}
```


I apologize - it appears the cBioPortal service is temporarily unavailable at the moment. However, I can guide you on how to explore ERBB2 mRNA expression across cancer types once the service is back online.

## What You're Looking For:

To compare **ERBB2 mRNA expression across different cancer types** in TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas, you would typically use the **Pan-Cancer Studies** feature in cBioPortal.

## Manual Navigation Steps:

1. **Go to:** https://www.cbioportal.org/

2. **Select Studies:** Look for TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies. The main one is:
   - **"TCGA PanCancer Atlas Studies"** - This is a collection of ~10,000 samples across 32 cancer types

3. **Query Setup:**
   - Enter gene: **ERBB2**
   - Select the Pan-Cancer Atlas study collection
   - Submit query

4. **Best Views for Your Question:**
   - **Cancer Types Summary Tab** - Shows ERBB2 alteration frequencies across all cancer types
   - **Plots Tab** - Create box plots or violin plots showing mRNA expression distribution by cancer type
   - **mRNA Expression Tab** - View expression data with cancer type annotations

## What You'll Discover:

ERBB2 (HER2) typically shows:
- **High amplification/overexpression** in breast cancer (especially HER2+ subtype)
- **Notable expression** in gastric, bladder, and ovarian cancers
- **Variable expression** across other cancer types

Would you like me to try again in a moment, or would you prefer specific guidance on analyzing the data once you access it?
