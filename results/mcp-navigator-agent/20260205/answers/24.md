# Question 24

**Type:** Treatment Response

**Question:** Which genomic alterations are associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore genomic alterations associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma patients from the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me start by finding this study and then navigate you to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD",

Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"No matching studies found","details":{"searchTerms":["MSK-CHORD","melanoma"]}}
```


Let me try a broader search for MSK-CHORD:

Great! I found the MSK-CHORD study. This is a large pan-cancer study with 25,040 samples. Now let me filter for melanoma patients and navigate you to the study view where you can explore genomic alterations associated with immunotherapy response.

I notice that the MSK-CHORD study doesn't appear to include melanoma patients in the available cancer types. The study focuses on five main cancer types: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, and Prostate Cancer.

Perfect! I found several melanoma studies in cBioPortal. Based on your interest in **immunotherapy response**, I recommend these specific studies that have immunotherapy-related data:

## **Recommended Studies with Immunotherapy Data:**

### 1. **Metastatic Melanoma (DFCI, Nature Medicine 2019)** - `mel_dfci_2019`
- 144 samples
- This study specifically focuses on immunotherapy response
- [View Study](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=mel_dfci_2019)

### 2. **Melanoma (MSK, Cell 2017) - iAtlas Harmonized** - `mel_iatlas_riaz_nivolumab_2017`
- 107 samples
- Focuses on **nivolumab** (anti-PD-1) immunotherapy
- [View Study](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=mel_iatlas_riaz_nivolumab_2017)

### 3. **Metastatic Melanoma (UCLA, Cell 2016)** - `mel_ucla_2016`
- 38 samples
- Examines immunotherapy response mechanisms
- [View Study](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=mel_ucla_2016)

### 4. **Melanoma (MSK, Clin Cancer Res 2021)** - `mel_mskimpact_2020`
- 696 samples (largest cohort)
- MSK-IMPACT sequencing with clinical outcomes
- [View Study](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=mel_mskimpact_2020)

## **Note about MSK-CHORD:**
The MSK-CHORD study (MSK, Nature 2024) does **not include melanoma patients**. It focuses on five cancer types: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, and Prostate Cancer.

---

**Would you like me to navigate you to one of these melanoma immunotherapy studies to explore genomic alterations?** I recommend starting with either:
- **mel_dfci_2019** (Nature Medicine 2019) - most directly focused on immunotherapy response
- **mel_iatlas_riaz_nivolumab_2017** (Cell 2017) - specifically nivolumab response data

Let me know which study interests you most, and I can generate a direct link to explore specific genomic alterations!
