Great! I found several endometrial cancer studies. For your question about copy-number high subtype, I recommend using the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018** study (`ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`), which has 529 samples and includes a "SUBTYPE" clinical attribute that should contain the molecular subtype classifications (including copy-number high).

Let me check what subtype values are available in this study:



Calling `get_clinical_attribute_values` with args:
```json
{
  "studyId": "ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018",
  "attributeIds": [
    "SUBTYPE"
  ]
}
```



Result from `get_clinical_attribute_values`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"Bad Gateway","details":{"status":502,"response":{"req":{"method":"POST","url":"https://www.cbioportal.org/api/clinical-data-counts/fetch","data":{"attributes":[{"attributeId":"SUBTYPE","values":[]}],"studyViewFilter":{"studyIds":["ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"]}},"headers":{"user-agent":"node-superagent/3.8.3","accept":"application/json","content-type":"application/json"}},"header":{"date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:47:49 GMT","content-type":"text/html","content-length":"150","connection":"close","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"},"status":502,"text":"<html>\r\n<head><title>502 Bad Gateway</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"}}}
```


I encountered a temporary server issue. Let me try creating the group comparison directly. Based on the TCGA endometrial cancer literature, the molecular subtypes typically include: POLE (ultramutated), MSI (hypermutated), Copy-Number Low (microsatellite stable), and Copy-Number High (serous-like). Let me create a comparison by the SUBTYPE attribute:



Calling `navigate_to_group_comparison` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "clinicalAttributeId": "SUBTYPE",
  "tab": "alterations"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_group_comparison`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"Service Unavailable","details":{"status":503,"response":{"req":{"method":"POST","url":"https://www.cbioportal.org/api/filtered-samples/fetch","data":{"studyIds":["ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"]},"headers":{"user-agent":"node-superagent/3.8.3","accept":"application/json","content-type":"application/json"}},"header":{"date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:47:53 GMT","content-type":"text/html","content-length":"190","connection":"close","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"},"status":503,"text":"<html>\r\n<head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"}}}

I'm experiencing temporary connectivity issues with the cBioPortal API. However, I can still guide you to the right place to answer your question.

## Direct Navigation to Compare Copy-Number High vs Other Subtypes

To explore the most frequently mutated genes in copy-number high subtype endometrial cancers compared to other subtypes, you can:

### **Option 1: Use the TCGA PanCancer Atlas Study (Recommended)**

1. **Go to the study page:**
   https://www.cbioportal.org/study?id=ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018

2. **Create groups by molecular subtype:**
   - In the StudyView, look for the "SUBTYPE" chart (should show categories like: POLE, MSI, CNV-High, CNV-Low)
   - Click on the chart to select specific subtypes
   - Use the "Compare Groups" feature to create a comparison

3. **View mutation differences:**
   - Once in the comparison view, navigate to the **"Alterations"** or **"Mutations"** tab
   - This will show you which genes are significantly more mutated in the copy-number high subtype

### **Option 2: Use the Original TCGA Nature 2013 Publication Study**

This study has well-defined molecular subtypes:
https://www.cbioportal.org/study?id=ucec_tcga_pub

The subtypes in this study are clearly defined and include:
- **POLE (ultramutated)**
- **MSI (hypermutated)**
- **Copy-number low (endometrioid)**
- **Copy-number high (serous-like)**

### **What to Expect:**

Based on the TCGA endometrial cancer research, the **copy-number high subtype** typically shows:
- **TP53 mutations** (very high frequency, ~90%)
- **PIK3CA mutations**
- **PPP2R1A mutations**
- **FBXW7 mutations**
- Extensive copy number alterations
- Lower mutation rates overall compared to POLE/MSI subtypes but with specific recurrent mutations

In contrast, other subtypes show:
- **POLE subtype**: Extremely high mutation burden, POLE mutations
- **MSI subtype**: High mutation burden, MLH1 silencing, PTEN, PIK3CA, ARID1A mutations
- **Copy-number low**: PTEN, PIK3CA, ARID1A, CTNNB1 mutations, fewer CNAs

Would you like me to try the API calls again, or would you prefer to navigate directly using the links I provided?
