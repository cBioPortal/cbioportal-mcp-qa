# Question 29

**Type:** Basic Query - Mutual Exclusivity

**Question:** "Are mutations in CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1 mutually exclusive in glioblastoma patients?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze the mutual exclusivity of mutations in CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1 in glioblastoma patients. Let me start by finding the appropriate glioblastoma study.

Great! I found several glioblastoma studies. For analyzing mutual exclusivity of mutations, I recommend the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas** version as it has the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis with 592 samples. Let me generate the direct link to view these three genes in the mutual exclusivity analysis:



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "CDKN2A",
    "CDK4",
    "RB1"
  ],
  "tab": "mutualExclusivity"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json
MCP error -32602: Input validation error: Invalid arguments for tool navigate_to_resultsview_page: [
  {
    "received": "mutualExclusivity",
    "code": "invalid_enum_value",
    "options": [
      "oncoprint",
      "mutations",
      "cna",
      "plots",
      "survival",
      "coexpression",
      "enrichments",
      "pathways"
    ],
    "path": [
      "tab"
    ],
    "message": "Invalid enum value. Expected 'oncoprint' | 'mutations' | 'cna' | 'plots' | 'survival' | 'coexpression' | 'enrichments' | 'pathways', received 'mutualExclusivity'"
  }
]
```


Let me generate the link to the OncoPrint view, where you can then access the mutual exclusivity analysis:



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "CDKN2A",
    "CDK4",
    "RB1"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json

```


Perfect! Here is the direct link to analyze CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1 mutations in glioblastoma:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&gene_list=CDKN2A+CDK4+RB1&case_set_id=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all**

This link opens the **Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study with 592 samples, showing alterations in CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1.

**To view the mutual exclusivity analysis:**

1. The link opens to the OncoPrint view showing alteration patterns across all samples
2. Navigate to the **"Mutual Exclusivity"** tab at the top of the results page
3. You'll see a statistical analysis showing whether mutations in these genes tend to:
   - **Co-occur** (happen together in the same samples)
   - Be **mutually exclusive** (rarely occur together)
   - Have **no significant relationship**

The mutual exclusivity analysis uses Fisher's exact test to calculate p-values and odds ratios for each gene pair (CDKN2A-CDK4, CDKN2A-RB1, CDK4-RB1).

**Biological Context:** These three genes are all involved in the RB1 tumor suppressor pathway, which controls cell cycle progression. It's an interesting research question whether alterations in different components of this pathway are redundant (mutually exclusive) or whether they provide additive effects (co-occurring).
