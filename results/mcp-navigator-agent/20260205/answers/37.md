# Question 37

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Gene Alteration

**Question:** Do ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 alterations have significantly different overall survival compared to wild-type patients?

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze the survival differences between BRCA1/BRCA2-altered and wild-type ovarian cancer patients. Let me start by finding the appropriate ovarian cancer study.

Perfect! I found several ovarian cancer studies. For your survival analysis question, I recommend using the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018** version (`ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`) as it has the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis with 585 samples and includes survival data.

To answer your question about survival differences between BRCA1/BRCA2-altered and wild-type patients, I'll create a direct link to the OncoPrint view with survival analysis for these genes:



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "BRCA1",
    "BRCA2"
  ],
  "tab": "survival"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/survival?cancer_study_list=ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&gene_list=BRCA1+BRCA2&case_set_id=ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/survival?cancer_study_list=ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&gene_list=BRCA1+BRCA2&case_set_id=ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all","data":{"studyIds":["ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"],"studies":[{"studyId":"ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","name":"Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","sampleCount":585}],"genes":["BRCA1","BRCA2"],"caseSetId":"ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all","molecularProfiles":["ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations"]}}

## Direct Link to Survival Analysis

**Here is your direct link to the survival analysis comparing BRCA1/BRCA2-altered vs wild-type ovarian cancer patients:**

## What You'll See

This link takes you directly to the **Survival tab** for BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the **Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study with 585 samples.

The survival analysis will show:
- **Kaplan-Meier curves** comparing patients with alterations in BRCA1/BRCA2 (mutations, amplifications, deep deletions) versus wild-type patients
- **Log-rank test p-value** indicating statistical significance
- **Median survival times** for each group
- **Number of patients** in altered vs unaltered groups

You can also:
- Switch between **Overall Survival (OS)**, **Disease-Free Survival (DFS)**, **Disease-Specific Survival (DSS)**, and **Progression-Free Survival (PFS)** using the dropdown menu
- View the **OncoPrint tab** to see the distribution of alterations across samples
- Explore the **Mutations tab** for specific mutation details

---

## Research Context

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are well-known tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair. In ovarian cancer, germline and somatic mutations in these genes are relatively common and have been associated with:
- Better response to platinum-based chemotherapy
- Sensitivity to PARP inhibitors
- Potentially different survival outcomes

The survival analysis in cBioPortal will help you visualize whether these associations hold in this TCGA cohort.

**Note:** This is for research purposes only and should not be used for clinical decision-making.
