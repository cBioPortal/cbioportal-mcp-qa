# Question 26

**Type:** Gene Panels

**Question:** What percentage of genomic events in the MSK-CHORD Study occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used)?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find information about off-panel genomic events in the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me first locate this study in cBioPortal.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study.

```


Great! I found the MSK-CHORD study (MSK, Nature 2024) with 25,040 samples. Now let me navigate to the study view where you can explore genomic event statistics.



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json

## About Off-Panel Events in MSK-CHORD

The MSK-CHORD study is a large pan-cancer cohort from Memorial Sloan Kettering that uses targeted sequencing panels (MSK-IMPACT and other panels). To find the percentage of genomic events that occur in off-panel genes, you should:

1. **Navigate to the study view** (link above) and look for charts or statistics about:
   - **Sample Coverage** - There's a clinical attribute called "SAMPLE_COVERAGE" which may indicate on-panel vs off-panel information
   - **Gene Panel** - The "GENE_PANEL" attribute shows which sequencing panel was used for each sample

2. **Check the Mutations Tab** in the study view, which typically shows:
   - Total mutation counts
   - Distribution across genes
   - Whether mutations are within the panel coverage

3. **Look for study-specific documentation** - The Nature 2024 publication associated with this study likely contains detailed statistics about off-panel events and panel coverage.

**Important Note:** Since MSK-CHORD uses targeted sequencing (not whole-exome or whole-genome), only genes included in the sequencing panels (like MSK-IMPACT) are analyzed. "Off-panel" events would refer to alterations detected through other methods or structural variants that extend beyond panel boundaries.

The study view will provide interactive charts where you can explore the distribution of genomic alterations across the cohort. Would you like me to help you filter or explore specific aspects of the data?
