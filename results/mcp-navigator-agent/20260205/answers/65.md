# Question 65

**Type:** Stratified Mutation Burden Analysis

**Question:** What is the average tumor mutational burden of breast cancer patients who have at least two of the five most frequently mutated genes and how does this compare to the average TMB of all patients?

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze tumor mutational burden (TMB) in breast cancer patients. Let me start by finding the appropriate breast cancer study and then we can explore the mutation data.

I found several TCGA breast cancer studies. For your analysis of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and frequently mutated genes, I recommend using the **Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study, as it's the most comprehensive and up-to-date version with 1,084 samples and includes TMB data.

Let me navigate to this study so you can perform your analysis:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","data":{"studyIds":["brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"],"studies":[{"studyId":"brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","name":"Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","sampleCount":1084}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Perfect! Here's your direct link to the **Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study:

## How to Answer Your Question:

To determine the average TMB of patients with at least 2 of the 5 most frequently mutated genes and compare it to all patients, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Top 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes
1. In the study view, scroll to the **"Mutated Genes"** table
2. Note the top 5 genes by alteration frequency (typically PIK3CA, TP53, CDH1, GATA3, MAP3K1 in breast cancer)

### Step 2: Filter for Patients with ≥2 of These Genes
1. Click on the **"Mutated Genes"** chart
2. Select the top 5 genes (hold Ctrl/Cmd to multi-select)
3. This will filter to patients with mutations in ANY of these genes
4. Note: cBioPortal doesn't have a built-in "at least 2 of 5" filter, so you'll need to:
   - Export the mutation data (Downloads tab)
   - Manually filter in Excel/R/Python for patients with ≥2 mutations

### Step 3: Compare TMB Values
1. In the filtered view, go to the **Clinical Data** tab
2. Find the **TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS** attribute
3. View the distribution and calculate the mean
4. Compare this to the TMB distribution of all patients (unfiltered view)

### Alternative Approach - Use OncoPrint:
You can also create an OncoPrint with the top 5 genes to visualize which patients have multiple mutations, then analyze TMB for that subset.

---

**Note:** The clinical attribute `TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS` contains the tumor mutational burden data for this study. You may need to download the data for detailed statistical analysis comparing the two groups.

Would you like me to help you create a specific filtered view or OncoPrint for particular genes?
