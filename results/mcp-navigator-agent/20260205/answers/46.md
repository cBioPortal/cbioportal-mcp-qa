# Question 46

**Type:** Pan-Cancer BRAF Analysis

**Question:** Which cancer types show the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the cancer types with the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies. Let me start by identifying the relevant studies.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "pan_can_atlas",
    "TCGA"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"Service Unavailable","details":{"status":503,"response":{"req":{"method":"GET","url":"https://www.cbioportal.org/api/column-store/studies","headers":{"user-agent":"node-superagent/3.8.3","accept":"application/json"}},"header":{"date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:48:08 GMT","content-type":"text/html","content-length":"190","connection":"close","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"},"status":503,"text":"<html>\r\n<head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"}}}
```


I apologize - the cBioPortal API is currently experiencing service issues. However, I can still help you with this query by providing you with the direct approach to answer your question.

## Recommended Approach for BRAF V600E Frequency Across Cancer Types

To find which cancer types show the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, you should use the **Cancer Types Summary** feature:

### Direct Navigation Path:

1. **Go to the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas Studies page:**
   https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets

2. **Query BRAF across all Pan-Cancer Atlas studies:**
   - You can create a cross-study query by selecting multiple TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas 2018 studies
   - Enter gene: **BRAF**
   - The system will show you the Cancer Types Summary

3. **Filter for V600E specifically:**
   - Once in the results view, navigate to the **Mutations** tab
   - You can filter for the specific V600E mutation (p.V600E)

### What You'll Find:

Based on published TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas data, **BRAF V600E** is known to be most frequent in:

- **Thyroid Cancer** (~60-80% of papillary thyroid carcinomas)
- **Melanoma** (~40-50%)
- **Colorectal Cancer** (~8-10%)
- **Lung Adenocarcinoma** (~1-3%)

### Alternative Direct Link Approach:

Once the service is restored, I can generate a direct link to query BRAF across all Pan-Cancer Atlas studies. The Cancer Types Summary view will show you a bar chart with mutation frequencies across all cancer types, making it easy to identify which have the highest V600E rates.

Would you like me to try again to generate the specific URL, or would you prefer guidance on any particular aspect of this analysis?
