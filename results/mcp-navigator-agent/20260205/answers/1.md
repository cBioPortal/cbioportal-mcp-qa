# Question 1

**Type:** Study Discovery

**Question:** How many studies are in cBioPortal?

**Answer:**

I can help you explore the studies available in cBioPortal. However, I don't have a direct tool to count the total number of studies across the entire portal.

The best way to see all available studies is to visit the **cBioPortal datasets page**:

**https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets**

This page provides a comprehensive, searchable list of all studies in cBioPortal, including:

- **TCGA** (The Cancer Genome Atlas) - comprehensive studies across ~30 cancer types
- **ICGC** (International Cancer Genome Consortium)
- **TARGET** - pediatric cancer studies
- **Individual institutional studies** from major cancer centers (MSK, DFCI, etc.)
- **Cell line genomics data**

The portal contains **hundreds of cancer studies** with varying sample sizes, cancer types, and data types (mutations, copy number alterations, expression data, etc.).

**If you're looking for a specific type of study**, I can help you search for it. For example:
- "Find lung cancer studies"
- "Show me TCGA breast cancer studies"
- "Find MSK-IMPACT studies"

Would you like me to help you find studies for a particular cancer type or research question?
