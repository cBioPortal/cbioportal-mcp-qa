# Question 43

**Type:** Clonality Analysis

**Question:** "In samples with both KRAS and NRAS mutations, what is the distribution of variant allele frequencies suggesting clonal vs subclonal events?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the variant allele frequencies (VAF) for samples with both KRAS and NRAS mutations. This is an interesting question about clonal architecture, as VAF can indicate whether mutations are clonal (typically VAF ~50% in diploid regions, suggesting early events) or subclonal (lower VAF, suggesting later events).

However, to proceed, I need to know which cancer study you'd like to analyze. Let me search for studies that would be relevant for KRAS/NRAS co-mutation analysis.

Could you specify:
1. **Cancer type** (e.g., colorectal, lung, melanoma, pancreatic)?
2. **Preferred study source** (e.g., TCGA, MSK-IMPACT, institutional studies)?

For example:
- **Colorectal cancer** - KRAS/NRAS mutations are common
- **Melanoma** - NRAS mutations are frequent
- **Lung adenocarcinoma** - KRAS mutations are very common
- **Pan-cancer studies** - For broader analysis across cancer types

Once you specify the study context, I can:
1. Generate a direct link to view KRAS and NRAS mutations together in an OncoPrint
2. Guide you to the **Mutations tab** where you can examine VAF distributions
3. Show you how to access the **Plots tab** to visualize VAF data for samples with both mutations

The VAF data (when available in the study) will be displayed in the mutation table and can help you distinguish:
- **Clonal mutations**: VAF ~40-60% (accounting for tumor purity and ploidy)
- **Subclonal mutations**: VAF <30-40%

Which cancer type or study would you like to explore?
