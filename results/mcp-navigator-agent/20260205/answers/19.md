# Question 19

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 10 most frequently mutated genes across all cancer types in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 10 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me start by resolving the study identifier and then navigate to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the MSK-CHORD study (MSK, Nature 2024) with 25,040 samples. Now let me navigate to the StudyView, which will show you the genomic overview including the most frequently mutated genes.



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


**Here is the direct link to the MSK-CHORD Study:**

This StudyView page will display the genomic overview for all 25,040 samples in the MSK-CHORD study. On this page, you'll find:

1. **Mutated Genes Chart** - This chart shows the most frequently mutated genes across the entire cohort, ranked by mutation frequency
2. The top 10 most frequently mutated genes will be displayed prominently in this visualization
3. You can see both the number and percentage of samples with mutations in each gene

The MSK-CHORD study is a pan-cancer study from Memorial Sloan Kettering published in Nature 2024, covering multiple cancer types including lung, breast, prostate, and others.

Once you open the link, look for the "Mutated Genes" panel on the summary tab - it will show you the ranked list of the most frequently altered genes with their mutation frequencies across all cancer types in this cohort.
