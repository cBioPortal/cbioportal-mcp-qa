# Question 67

**Type:** Genomic Alteration–Subtype Association

**Question:** In the TCGA Breast Cancer study if a patient has both a PIK3CA mutation and a PTEN deletion what is their probability of having a luminal A subtype? Is this probability different from a patient with only a PIK3CA mutation?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the relationship between PIK3CA mutations, PTEN deletions, and luminal A subtype in TCGA Breast Cancer. Let me start by finding the appropriate study and then navigate to the right view.

I found several TCGA Breast Cancer studies. For your question about PAM50 subtypes (luminal A), I recommend using the **"Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2012)"** study (`brca_tcga_pub`), as it has the `PAM50_SUBTYPE` clinical attribute which includes luminal A classification.

However, to answer your specific question about **conditional probabilities** (the probability of luminal A subtype given specific mutation patterns), cBioPortal doesn't directly calculate these statistics. But I can guide you to views where you can explore this relationship:

## Approach 1: Filter and Compare Groups

Let me create filtered views to help you explore this:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "brca_tcga_pub"
  ],
  "filterJson": {
    "geneFilters": [
      {
        "molecularProfileIds": [
          "brca_tcga_pub_mutations"
        ],
        "geneQueries": [
          [
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "PIK3CA"
            }
          ]
        ]
      },
      {
        "molecularProfileIds": [
          "brca_tcga_pub_gistic"
        ],
        "geneQueries": [
          [
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "PTEN",
              "alterations": [
                "HOMDEL"
              ]
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pub#filterJson={\"geneFilters\":[{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"PIK3CA\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"brca_tcga_pub_mutations\"]},{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"alterations\":[\"HOMDEL\"],\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"PTEN\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"brca_tcga_pub_gistic\"]}]}","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pub#filterJson={\"geneFilters\":[{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"PIK3CA\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"brca_tcga_pub_mutations\"]},{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"alterations\":[\"HOMDEL\"],\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"PTEN\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"brca_tcga_pub_gistic\"]}]}","data":{"studyIds":["brca_tcga_pub"],"studies":[{"studyId":"brca_tcga_pub","name":"Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2012)","sampleCount":825}],"hasFilters":true,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```




Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "brca_tcga_pub"
  ],
  "filterJson": {
    "geneFilters": [
      {
        "molecularProfileIds": [
          "brca_tcga_pub_mutations"
        ],
        "geneQueries": [
          [
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "PIK3CA"
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pub#filterJson={\"geneFilters\":[{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"PIK3CA\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"brca_tcga_pub_mutations\"]}]}","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pub#filterJson={\"geneFilters\":[{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"PIK3CA\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"brca_tcga_pub_mutations\"]}]}","data":{"studyIds":["brca_tcga_pub"],"studies":[{"studyId":"brca_tcga_pub","name":"Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2012)","sampleCount":825}],"hasFilters":true,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Perfect! Here are the filtered views to explore your question:

## **View 1: Patients with BOTH PIK3CA mutation AND PTEN deletion**
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pub#filterJson={%22geneFilters%22:[{%22geneQueries%22:[[{%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22PIK3CA%22}],%22molecularProfileIds%22:[%22brca_tcga_pub_mutations%22]},{%22geneQueries%22:[[{%22alterations%22:[%22HOMDEL%22],%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22PTEN%22}]],%22molecularProfileIds%22:[%22brca_tcga_pub_gistic%22]}]}

## **View 2: Patients with ONLY PIK3CA mutation (no PTEN filter)**
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pub#filterJson={%22geneFilters%22:[{%22geneQueries%22:[[{%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22PIK3CA%22}]],%22molecularProfileIds%22:[%22brca_tcga_pub_mutations%22]}]}

---

## How to Calculate the Probabilities:

1. **Open each link above** - they will show you the filtered patient cohorts
2. **Look at the PAM50 Subtype chart** in the Clinical Data section of each StudyView
3. **Calculate the proportions:**
   - For each view, note the number of patients with "Luminal A" subtype
   - Divide by the total number of patients in that filtered cohort
   - This gives you P(Luminal A | mutation pattern)

4. **Compare the two probabilities** to see if having both PIK3CA mutation + PTEN deletion changes the likelihood of luminal A subtype compared to PIK3CA mutation alone

---

## Alternative: Use OncoPrint for Visual Analysis

You can also visualize this relationship using an OncoPrint:



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "brca_tcga_pub"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "PIK3CA",
    "PTEN"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=brca_tcga_pub&gene_list=PIK3CA+PTEN&case_set_id=brca_tcga_pub_all","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=brca_tcga_pub&gene_list=PIK3CA+PTEN&case_set_id=brca_tcga_pub_all","data":{"studyIds":["brca_tcga_pub"],"studies":[{"studyId":"brca_tcga_pub","name":"Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2012)","sampleCount":825}],"genes":["PIK3CA","PTEN"],"caseSetId":"brca_tcga_pub_all","molecularProfiles":["brca_tcga_pub_mutations"]}}
```


## **OncoPrint View: PIK3CA and PTEN alterations**
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=brca_tcga_pub&gene_list=PIK3CA+PTEN&case_set_id=brca_tcga_pub_all

In the OncoPrint view:
- You can **sort by PAM50_SUBTYPE** (click on the clinical tracks at the bottom)
- This will visually show you the distribution of PIK3CA mutations and PTEN deletions across different subtypes
- You can also use the **Plots tab** to create scatter plots or bar charts showing the relationship between these alterations and PAM50 subtype

## Summary

To answer your question precisely, you'll need to:
1. Use the filtered StudyViews to count patients in each category
2. Calculate: 
   - P(Luminal A | PIK3CA mut + PTEN del) from View 1
   - P(Luminal A | PIK3CA mut) from View 2
3. Compare these probabilities

**Note:** cBioPortal is a research tool for exploratory analysis. The probabilities you calculate are descriptive statistics from this specific TCGA cohort and should not be used for clinical decision-making without appropriate statistical validation and consideration of study limitations.
