# Question 5

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find information about treatments in the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me first resolve this study and navigate to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Now let me navigate to the MSK-CHORD study view where you can explore treatment information:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Here is the direct link to the MSK-CHORD Study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024**

This study contains **25,040 samples** from the MSK-CHORD cohort (MSK, Nature 2024).

To find treatment information:

1. **On the Study View page**, scroll down to look for treatment-related charts or clinical data visualizations
2. Navigate to the **Clinical Data tab** to see all available clinical attributes, including any treatment information
3. Look for charts showing treatment distributions or therapy types

The MSK-CHORD study is a large pan-cancer cohort from Memorial Sloan Kettering. Treatment data availability and detail will depend on what was collected and published with this dataset. The study view will display any available treatment information in the clinical data charts.

If you need help interpreting specific treatment data once you're on the page, feel free to ask!
