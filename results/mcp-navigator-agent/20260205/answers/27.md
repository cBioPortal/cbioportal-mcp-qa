# Question 27

**Type:** Expression Analysis

**Question:** Is there a correlation between ERBB2 gene amplification and ERBB2 protein expression levels in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the correlation between ERBB2 gene amplification and ERBB2 protein expression in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study.

Let me start by resolving the study and then navigate to the appropriate view:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD",
    "breast"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"No matching studies found","details":{"searchTerms":["MSK-CHORD","breast"]}}
```


Let me try a broader search for MSK-CHORD:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK",
    "CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_resultsview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_resultsview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the MSK-CHORD study. This is a pan-cancer study that includes breast cancer samples. Now let me navigate to the Plots tab where you can visualize the correlation between ERBB2 copy number alterations (amplification) and ERBB2 protein expression:



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "ERBB2"
  ],
  "tab": "plots"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/plots?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=ERBB2&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/plots?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=ERBB2&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"genes":["ERBB2"],"caseSetId":"msk_chord_2024_all","molecularProfiles":["msk_chord_2024_mutations"]}}
```


Excellent! Here's the direct link to explore the correlation between ERBB2 gene amplification and protein expression in the MSK-CHORD Study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/plots?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=ERBB2&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all**

## How to visualize the correlation:

Once you're on the Plots tab, you can:

1. **Set up the scatter plot:**
   - **X-axis:** Select "ERBB2" and choose "Copy Number Alteration" (CNA) data type
   - **Y-axis:** Select "ERBB2" and choose "Protein Expression" data type (if available in this study)

2. **Filter for breast cancer samples:**
   - Use the cancer type filter to select only breast cancer samples from this pan-cancer study

3. **Interpret the visualization:**
   - Each point represents a sample
   - Amplified samples (high CNA values) should cluster on the right
   - If there's a positive correlation, you'll see amplified samples also showing higher protein expression levels (higher Y-axis values)

**Note:** The MSK-CHORD study primarily contains genomic data (mutations, CNA, structural variants). If protein expression data (e.g., RPPA or mass spectrometry) is not available for ERBB2 in this study, you may need to explore other breast cancer studies like TCGA or METABRIC that include both CNA and protein/mRNA expression data.

Would you like me to help you find an alternative breast cancer study with both CNA and expression data if needed?
