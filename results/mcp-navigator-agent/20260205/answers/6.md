# Question 6

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study. Let me start by finding the correct study.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "TARGET",
    "osteosarcoma"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["os_target_gdc"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","sampleCount":159,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["AGE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","DAYS_TO_BIRTH","DAYS_TO_DEATH","DISEASE_TYPE","ETHNICITY","MUTATION_COUNT","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS","PRIMARY_SITE_PATIENT","PROJECT_ID","RACE","SAMPLE_COUNT","SEX","SPECIMEN_TYPE","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","VITAL_STATUS"],"molecularProfileIds":["os_target_gdc_cna","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_read_counts_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mutations","os_target_gdc_rna_seq_mrna"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the TARGET Osteosarcoma study. Now let me navigate to the StudyView where you can see the mutation frequency data and identify the top mutated genes.



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "os_target_gdc"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc","data":{"studyIds":["os_target_gdc"],"studies":[{"studyId":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","sampleCount":159}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Here is the direct link to the TARGET Osteosarcoma study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc**

This StudyView page for the **Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)** study contains 159 samples. 

On this page, you'll find a chart showing the **"Mutated Genes"** which displays the most frequently mutated genes in this cohort ranked by mutation frequency. The chart typically shows the top mutated genes with their mutation counts and percentages.

To see the detailed mutation frequencies:
1. Look for the "Mutated Genes" chart on the summary tab
2. The genes are ranked by frequency (most mutated at the top)
3. You can click on individual genes to see more details about the specific mutations

The study includes mutation data (molecular profile: `os_target_gdc_mutations`) along with copy number alterations and RNA-seq expression data.
