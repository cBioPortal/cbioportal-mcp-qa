# Question 28

**Type:** Basic Query - Pathway Analysis

**Question:** "What percentage of glioblastoma patients have alterations in RB pathway genes (CDKN2A, CDK4, RB1)?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the alteration frequency for RB pathway genes in glioblastoma. Let me start by identifying the appropriate glioblastoma study and then query for these genes.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "glioblastoma",
    "TCGA"
  ]
}

Great! I found several glioblastoma studies. For the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis, I'll use the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018** dataset, which has 592 samples and is the recommended version for TCGA data.

Perfect! Here's the direct link to view RB pathway gene alterations in glioblastoma:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&gene_list=CDKN2A+CDK4+RB1&case_set_id=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all**

This OncoPrint view shows alterations in **CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1** across 592 glioblastoma samples from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018 study.

**What you'll see:**
- **OncoPrint visualization** showing the alteration pattern for each gene across all samples
- **Alteration frequency** at the top of each gene row (showing the percentage of samples with alterations)
- **Types of alterations** including:
  - Deep deletions (common for CDKN2A and RB1 as tumor suppressors)
  - Amplifications (common for CDK4 as an oncogene)
  - Mutations

The RB pathway is frequently disrupted in glioblastoma, and you'll likely see that a substantial percentage of patients have alterations in at least one of these three genes. The OncoPrint will also show you whether these alterations tend to be mutually exclusive or co-occurring.

You can also navigate to the **"Cancer Types Summary"** tab to see the exact percentage breakdown for each gene.
