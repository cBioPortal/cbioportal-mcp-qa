# Question 41

**Type:** Protein Pathway Analysis

**Question:** How does PTEN alteration (mutations or homozygous deletions) affect pAKT protein levels in lung squamous cell carcinoma?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the relationship between PTEN alterations and pAKT protein levels in lung squamous cell carcinoma. Let me start by finding the appropriate study and then navigate you to the analysis.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "TCGA",
    "lung",
    "squamous"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"Service Unavailable","details":{"status":503,"response":{"req":{"method":"POST","url":"https://www.cbioportal.org/api/molecular-profiles/fetch?projection=ID","data":{"studyIds":["lusc_tcga"]},"headers":{"user-agent":"node-superagent/3.8.3","accept":"application/json","content-type":"application/json"}},"header":{"date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:46:02 GMT","content-type":"text/html","content-length":"190","connection":"close","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"},"status":503,"text":"<html>\r\n<head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"}}}
```


I'm encountering a temporary service issue with the cBioPortal API. However, I can still guide you to the correct analysis based on my knowledge of the platform.

For analyzing how PTEN alterations affect pAKT protein levels in lung squamous cell carcinoma, you'll want to use the **TCGA Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study, which has both mutation/CNA data and RPPA (protein) data.

## Direct Navigation Path:

**Here's the direct URL to query PTEN in the TCGA Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma study:**

https://www.cbioportal.org/results/oncoprint?Action=Submit&RPPA_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&cancer_study_list=lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&case_set_id=lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_cnaseq&data_priority=0&gene_list=PTEN&geneset_list=%20&genetic_profile_ids_PROFILE_COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION=lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_gistic&genetic_profile_ids_PROFILE_MUTATION_EXTENDED=lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations&profileFilter=0&tab_index=tab_visualize

## To analyze PTEN alterations vs pAKT protein levels:

1. **Start at the URL above** - this shows PTEN alterations (mutations and CNAs)

2. **Navigate to the Plots tab** in the results view

3. **Configure the plot:**
   - **X-axis:** Select "PTEN" with "Mutation Type" or "Copy Number"
   - **Y-axis:** Select "Protein Level (RPPA)" and search for "pAKT" (likely listed as "AKT_pS473" or "AKT_pT308")
   
4. **Analyze the visualization:** The plot will show pAKT protein levels stratified by PTEN alteration status (mutated, homozygously deleted, diploid, etc.)

## Expected Biological Relationship:

PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Loss of PTEN function (through mutations or homozygous deletions) typically leads to:
- **Increased AKT phosphorylation** (higher pAKT levels)
- Constitutive pathway activation

The Plots tab will show you whether this expected inverse relationship holds true in the TCGA lung squamous cell carcinoma cohort.

**Note:** This is for research purposes only and cannot be used for clinical decision-making.

Once the cBioPortal service is back online, the tools will work automatically. Would you like me to try again, or would you prefer additional guidance on interpreting the plots?
