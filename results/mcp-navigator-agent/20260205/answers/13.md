# Question 13

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What percentage of patients in the MSK-CHORD Study have at least one TP53 mutation?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the percentage of patients with TP53 mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me start by resolving the study and then navigating to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_resultsview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_resultsview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the MSK-CHORD study. Now let me generate the direct link to view TP53 mutations in this study.



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "TP53"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=TP53&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=TP53&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"genes":["TP53"],"caseSetId":"msk_chord_2024_all","molecularProfiles":["msk_chord_2024_mutations"]}}
```


Here is the direct link to view TP53 mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=TP53&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all**

This link will take you to the **OncoPrint view** where you can see:
- The percentage of patients with TP53 mutations (displayed at the top of the OncoPrint)
- The specific types of TP53 alterations (mutations, amplifications, deletions)
- Individual patient-level mutation data

The MSK-CHORD study contains **25,040 samples** across multiple cancer types. The OncoPrint will show you the exact percentage of patients with at least one TP53 mutation, which is typically displayed as "TP53: X% altered" in the visualization.

You can also navigate to the **Mutations tab** from this view to see detailed information about specific TP53 mutations, their frequencies, and functional impact.
