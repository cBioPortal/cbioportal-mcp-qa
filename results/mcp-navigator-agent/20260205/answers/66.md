# Question 66

**Type:** Cross-Cohort Comparison

**Question:** In colorectal cancer do patients with microsatellite instability in the TCGA dataset have a similar prognosis as those in the MSK Gastroenterology 2020 study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you compare the prognosis of microsatellite instability (MSI) patients between these two colorectal cancer studies. Let me start by finding the relevant TCGA and MSK studies.

Great! I found the relevant studies. For TCGA, I'll use the **PanCancer Atlas 2018** version (most comprehensive), and I found the **MSK Gastroenterology 2020** study. Now let me check what microsatellite instability attributes are available in each study.

Perfect! Now I can see the MSI data available in both studies. Let me create comparison views for each study to analyze survival by MSI status. I'll use the MSI_TYPE attribute for the MSK study (which has categorical values: Instable, Stable, Indeterminate) and create a comparison based on MSI_SCORE_MANTIS for the TCGA study (using the threshold >0.6 for MSI-high).

For the TCGA study, since MSI_SCORE_MANTIS is numerical, the tool will automatically create quartile groups. However, for a more clinically meaningful comparison, let me create filtered studyviews for MSI-high vs MSS patients in each study and provide you with comparison URLs.

I see there's a technical issue with the comparison tool. Let me provide you with direct links to the study views where you can manually set up the survival comparisons for MSI status in both studies:

## **Comparing MSI Prognosis Between TCGA and MSK Studies**

To answer your question about whether MSI patients have similar prognosis between these two studies, here are the direct study links where you can perform survival analysis:

### **1. TCGA Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (PanCancer Atlas 2018)**
**Study Overview:** https://www.cbioportal.org/study?id=coadread_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018

- **594 samples** with MSI data
- **MSI Scoring:** Uses MSI_SCORE_MANTIS (threshold: MSI-high >0.6, MSS <0.4)
- This study has comprehensive survival data (OS, DFS, PFS)

### **2. MSK Colorectal Cancer (Gastroenterology 2020)**
**Study Overview:** https://www.cbioportal.org/study?id=crc_apc_impact_2020

- **471 samples** with MSI data
- **MSI Classification:** Uses MSI_TYPE (categorical: "Instable", "Stable", "Indeterminate")
- This is a metastatic colorectal cancer cohort with OS and PFS data

---

## **How to Compare Survival by MSI Status:**

### **For the TCGA Study:**
1. Go to the TCGA study link above
2. In the study view, navigate to the **Clinical Data** tab
3. Find the **MSI_SCORE_MANTIS** attribute
4. Click on the survival icon to generate Kaplan-Meier curves comparing MSI-high (>0.6) vs MSS (<0.4) patients

### **For the MSK Study:**
1. Go to the MSK study link above
2. In the study view, navigate to the **Clinical Data** tab
3. Find the **MSI_TYPE** attribute
4. Click on the survival icon to compare "Instable" (MSI-high) vs "Stable" (MSS) patients

---

## **Key Considerations for Your Comparison:**

### **Study Differences:**
- **TCGA**: Mixed stage colorectal cancer (includes early and advanced stages)
- **MSK 2020**: Primarily **metastatic** colorectal cancer patients (more advanced disease)

### **Expected Findings:**
Based on the literature, MSI-high colorectal cancers generally have:
- **Better prognosis** in early-stage disease (TCGA will likely show this)
- **Different response patterns** in metastatic disease (MSK study context)
- MSI-high tumors respond well to immunotherapy but may have different outcomes with traditional chemotherapy

### **Important Note:**
The MSK study focuses on metastatic disease, so direct comparison of overall survival between these cohorts may not be appropriate due to different disease stages. You may want to:
1. Filter the TCGA cohort to advanced stages (Stage III/IV) for a more comparable analysis
2. Focus on comparing the **relative** survival benefit of MSI vs MSS within each study rather than absolute survival times

---

**Research Context:** cBioPortal is for research purposes only. These survival analyses can help identify patterns in genomic data but should not be used for clinical decision-making.

Would you like me to help you create filtered views for specific stages or other clinical subgroups to make the comparison more meaningful?
