# Question 14

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** Which cancer type has the highest average tumor mutational burden across all studies?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find which cancer type has the highest average tumor mutational burden across all studies in cBioPortal. However, this type of cross-study aggregate analysis isn't directly available through the navigation tools I have access to.

Let me explain what's possible and provide you with the best approach:

## What cBioPortal Offers:

1. **Individual Study TMB Data**: You can view tumor mutational burden (TMB) distributions within specific studies through the StudyView page, where TMB is often displayed as a clinical attribute or genomic feature.

2. **Pan-Cancer Studies**: The TCGA PanCancer Atlas studies are particularly useful for comparing TMB across cancer types, as they use standardized processing pipelines.

## Recommended Approach:

The best resource for this question would be the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas** studies, which analyzed ~10,000 tumors across 33 cancer types with uniform methodology. Let me get you to a relevant starting point:

Perfect! I found all 32 TCGA PanCancer Atlas studies. I can see that each study has the **TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS** clinical attribute, which represents tumor mutational burden.

## Answer Based on Published Literature:

Based on the TCGA PanCancer Atlas analysis, **cancer types with the highest average TMB are:**

1. **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM)** - Highest TMB
2. **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)** - Very high TMB
3. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** - Very high TMB
4. **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA)** - High TMB
5. **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)** - High TMB (especially MSI-high subtype)

Cancer types with the **lowest TMB** include:
- Acute Myeloid Leukemia (LAML)
- Thyroid Carcinoma (THCA)
- Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PCPG)

## Explore the Data Yourself:

You can view and compare TMB distributions across these cancer types. Here are direct links to some of the highest TMB cancer types:

In each study view, you can find the TMB distribution in the clinical data charts. The high TMB in melanoma and lung cancers is attributed to UV radiation and tobacco carcinogen exposure, respectively, which cause high mutation rates.
