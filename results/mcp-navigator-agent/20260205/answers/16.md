# Question 16

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many unique patients have both primary and metastatic samples in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find information about patients with both primary and metastatic samples in the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me start by resolving the study identifier.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Great! I found the MSK-CHORD study (msk_chord_2024). Now let me check the clinical attributes to see if we can filter by sample type to identify patients with both primary and metastatic samples.



Calling `get_clinical_attribute_values` with args:
```json
{
  "studyId": "msk_chord_2024",
  "attributeIds": [
    "SAMPLE_TYPE",
    "SAMPLE_CLASS"
  ]
}
```



Result from `get_clinical_attribute_values`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Successfully retrieved clinical attribute values","data":{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","attributes":[{"attributeId":"SAMPLE_CLASS","displayName":"Sample Class","description":"The sample classification (i.e., tumor, cellline, xenograph).Source: MPath","datatype":"STRING","values":["Tumor"]},{"attributeId":"SAMPLE_TYPE","displayName":"Sample Type","description":"The type assigned to a sample (i.e., normal, primary, met, recurrence). Source: MPath","datatype":"STRING","values":["Local Recurrence","Primary","Unknown","Metastasis"]}]}}
```


Perfect! The study has a SAMPLE_TYPE attribute with values including "Primary" and "Metastasis". To answer your question about patients with both primary and metastatic samples, I'll need to navigate to the study view where you can explore this information.

Let me provide you with the direct link to the MSK-CHORD study:

**MSK-CHORD Study (MSK, Nature 2024):**
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024

This study contains **25,040 samples** total.

To find the number of unique patients with both primary and metastatic samples, you can:

1. **Navigate to the study view** using the link above
2. **Go to the Clinical Data tab** in the study view
3. **Look at the SAMPLE_TYPE distribution** - you'll see samples classified as:
   - Primary
   - Metastasis
   - Local Recurrence
   - Unknown

4. **To identify patients with multiple sample types**, you can:
   - Use the "Plots" tab to create a visualization showing SAMPLE_TYPE distribution per patient
   - Filter the data to show only patients who have samples in both "Primary" and "Metastasis" categories

Unfortunately, I cannot directly query the exact count of patients with both sample types through the navigation tools, but the study view interface will allow you to explore this interactively. The study's clinical data tables and visualization tools will help you identify these patients.

Would you like me to help you navigate to a specific view or filter the data in a particular way?
