# Question 35

**Type:** Mutation Impact on Expression

**Question:** Do samples with TP53 truncating mutations have significantly lower TP53 mRNA expression compared to wild-type samples?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the relationship between TP53 truncating mutations and TP53 mRNA expression levels in cBioPortal. To do this, I need to first identify which study you'd like to analyze.

Let me search for available studies. Could you specify which cancer type or study you're interested in? For example:
- A specific cancer type (e.g., lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer)
- A specific study (e.g., TCGA PanCancer Atlas, MSK-IMPACT)
- Or would you like me to use a comprehensive pan-cancer dataset?

If you don't have a preference, I can use the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas** studies, which are comprehensive and well-suited for this type of analysis.

Once we identify the study, I can guide you to:
1. **Query TP53** in the study
2. Navigate to the **Plots tab** where you can:
   - Set the Y-axis to TP53 mRNA expression
   - Group samples by TP53 mutation type (truncating vs wild-type)
   - Visualize the expression differences with box plots
   - See statistical significance tests

Please let me know which cancer type or study you'd like to explore, and I'll generate the direct link for you.
