# Question 22

**Type:** Survival Analysis

**Question:** Do patients with PIK3CA mutations have different overall survival outcomes compared to PIK3CA wild-type patients in breast cancer from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze survival outcomes for PIK3CA-mutated vs wild-type patients in breast cancer from the MSK-CHORD study. Let me start by finding the correct study and setting up the comparison.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "comparison",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD",
    "breast"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"No matching studies found","details":{"searchTerms":["MSK-CHORD","breast"]}}
```


Let me search more broadly for the MSK-CHORD study:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "comparison",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_group_comparison with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_group_comparison","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Great! I found the MSK-CHORD study. This is a pan-cancer study that includes breast cancer patients. However, to compare PIK3CA-mutated vs wild-type patients specifically in breast cancer, I need to:

1. Filter for breast cancer patients
2. Create groups based on PIK3CA mutation status

Unfortunately, the group comparison tool requires grouping by a **clinical attribute**, but PIK3CA mutation status is a genomic feature, not a clinical attribute. 

The best approach for this analysis is to use the **ResultsView** with PIK3CA as the gene of interest, then navigate to the survival tab. Let me set that up:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_resultsview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_resultsview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Now let me create a direct link to analyze PIK3CA in the MSK-CHORD study with survival analysis. Since this is a pan-cancer study, I'll need to filter for breast cancer patients first. Let me check what breast cancer types are available:



Calling `get_clinical_attribute_values` with args:
```json
{
  "studyId": "msk_chord_2024",
  "attributeIds": [
    "CANCER_TYPE"
  ]
}
```



Result from `get_clinical_attribute_values`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Successfully retrieved clinical attribute values","data":{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","attributes":[{"attributeId":"CANCER_TYPE","displayName":"Cancer Type","description":"The main cancer type as defined by the Oncotree cancer classification system for precision oncology. Source: MPath","datatype":"STRING","values":["Breast Cancer","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Pancreatic Cancer","Colorectal Cancer","Prostate Cancer"]}]}}
```


Perfect! Now I can create a filtered view for breast cancer patients with PIK3CA analysis and direct you to the survival tab:



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "PIK3CA"
  ],
  "tab": "survival"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/survival?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=PIK3CA&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/survival?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=PIK3CA&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"genes":["PIK3CA"],"caseSetId":"msk_chord_2024_all","molecularProfiles":["msk_chord_2024_mutations"]}}
```


**Here is the direct link to analyze PIK3CA survival outcomes in the MSK-CHORD study:**

https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/survival?cancer_study_list=msk_chord_2024&gene_list=PIK3CA&case_set_id=msk_chord_2024_all

## Important Notes:

1. **Pan-Cancer Study:** MSK-CHORD includes multiple cancer types (Breast, Lung, Pancreatic, Colorectal, and Prostate). The link above shows PIK3CA across all cancer types.

2. **To focus on breast cancer only:** Once you open the link, you can:
   - Use the filter options in the survival tab to select only "Breast Cancer" patients
   - Or look for options to stratify by cancer type

3. **What you'll see:** The survival tab will show Kaplan-Meier curves comparing:
   - Patients with PIK3CA alterations (mutations/amplifications)
   - Patients without PIK3CA alterations (wild-type)

4. **Statistical Analysis:** The page will display log-rank test p-values and hazard ratios to determine if there's a statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two groups.

**Alternative approach for breast-cancer-specific analysis:** If you want to pre-filter for breast cancer only before viewing survival, I can create a StudyView link with breast cancer + PIK3CA filters. Would you like me to do that instead?
