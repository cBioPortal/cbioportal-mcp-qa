# Question 21

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the most commonly co-occurring mutation pairs in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most commonly co-occurring mutation pairs in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me start by resolving the study and then navigating to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD",
    "breast"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"No matching studies found","details":{"searchTerms":["MSK-CHORD","breast"]}}
```


Let me try a broader search for MSK-CHORD:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_resultsview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_resultsview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Great! I found the MSK-CHORD study. This is a pan-cancer study that includes breast cancer samples. To analyze co-occurring mutations in breast cancer specifically, I'll need to navigate to the study view first and filter for breast cancer samples, then look at commonly mutated genes.

However, to directly answer your question about co-occurring mutation pairs, the best approach is to:

1. First, let me take you to the breast cancer subset of this study
2. From there, you can identify the most frequently mutated genes
3. Then query those genes together to see their co-occurrence patterns

Let me create a filtered view for breast cancer samples:



Calling `get_clinical_attribute_values` with args:
```json
{
  "studyId": "msk_chord_2024",
  "attributeIds": [
    "CANCER_TYPE"
  ]
}
```



Result from `get_clinical_attribute_values`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Successfully retrieved clinical attribute values","data":{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","attributes":[{"attributeId":"CANCER_TYPE","displayName":"Cancer Type","description":"The main cancer type as defined by the Oncotree cancer classification system for precision oncology. Source: MPath","datatype":"STRING","values":["Breast Cancer","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Pancreatic Cancer","Colorectal Cancer","Prostate Cancer"]}]}}
```


Perfect! Now let me navigate to the breast cancer subset of the MSK-CHORD study:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ],
  "filterJson": {
    "clinicalDataFilters": [
      {
        "attributeId": "CANCER_TYPE",
        "values": [
          {
            "value": "Breast Cancer"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024#filterJson={\"clinicalDataFilters\":[{\"attributeId\":\"CANCER_TYPE\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Breast Cancer\"}]}]}","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024#filterJson={\"clinicalDataFilters\":[{\"attributeId\":\"CANCER_TYPE\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Breast Cancer\"}]}]}","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"hasFilters":true,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Excellent! Here's the direct link to the **breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study**:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024#filterJson={%22clinicalDataFilters%22:[{%22attributeId%22:%22CANCER_TYPE%22,%22values%22:[{%22value%22:%22Breast%20Cancer%22}]}]}**

## To find the most commonly co-occurring mutation pairs:

1. **Visit the link above** - This shows all breast cancer samples from MSK-CHORD
2. **Look at the "Mutated Genes" table** on the summary page - This will show you the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer samples
3. **Select the top mutated genes** (typically PIK3CA, TP53, CDH1, GATA3, MAP3K1, etc. are common in breast cancer)
4. **Query those genes together** to see their co-occurrence patterns

Once you identify the top genes from the study view, I can help you create an OncoPrint with those specific genes to visualize their co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity patterns. The **Mutual Exclusivity tab** in the results view will show you statistical analysis of which gene pairs tend to co-occur or are mutually exclusive.

Would you like me to create a query with commonly known breast cancer genes (like PIK3CA, TP53, CDH1, GATA3, MAP3K1, ESR1) to get you started with the co-occurrence analysis?
