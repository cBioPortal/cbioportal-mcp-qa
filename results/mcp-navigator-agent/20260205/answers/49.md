# Question 49

**Type:** Aneuploidy Analysis

**Question:** Which cancer types have the highest aneuploidy scores and how does this correlate with mutation burden across TCGA Pan-Cancer studies?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore aneuploidy scores and mutation burden across TCGA Pan-Cancer studies. Let me start by finding the appropriate pan-cancer study.

Perfect! I can see that the TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018 studies include **ANEUPLOIDY_SCORE** as a clinical attribute. This is exactly what you need. I notice there are individual cancer type studies from the PanCancer Atlas (e.g., brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018, coadread_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018, etc.), each with aneuploidy scores.

To answer your question about which cancer types have the highest aneuploidy scores and how this correlates with mutation burden (TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS), you'll want to explore these studies. Let me provide you with the best approach:

## Recommended Approach:

**For a comprehensive pan-cancer view**, I recommend using the **Plots tab** in StudyView to create scatter plots comparing aneuploidy scores vs. mutation burden across multiple cancer types. You can do this by:

1. **Querying multiple TCGA PanCancer Atlas studies together** - This allows cross-cancer comparison
2. **Using the Plots tab** to visualize ANEUPLOIDY_SCORE (Y-axis) vs TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS or MUTATION_COUNT (X-axis)
3. **Coloring by CANCER_TYPE** to see which cancer types cluster where

Let me generate a URL for you to explore several major cancer types together:

## What This Shows:

This scatter plot displays:
- **X-axis:** TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS (Tumor Mutation Burden - nonsynonymous mutations)
- **Y-axis:** ANEUPLOIDY_SCORE (chromosomal instability measure)
- **Color:** Each cancer type is color-coded for easy identification
- **Total samples:** ~7,000+ samples across 16 cancer types

---

## Cancer Types Included:

1. **Breast Invasive Carcinoma** (1,084 samples)
2. **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma** (594 samples)
3. **Glioblastoma Multiforme** (592 samples)
4. **Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma** (585 samples)
5. **Lung Adenocarcinoma** (566 samples)
6. **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma** (529 samples)
7. **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma** (523 samples)
8. **Brain Lower Grade Glioma** (514 samples)
9. **Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma** (512 samples)
10. **Thyroid Carcinoma** (500 samples)
11. **Prostate Adenocarcinoma** (494 samples)
12. **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma** (487 samples)
13. **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma** (448 samples)
14. **Stomach Adenocarcinoma** (440 samples)
15. **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma** (411 samples)
16. **Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma** (372 samples)

---

## Expected Patterns (Based on Literature):
