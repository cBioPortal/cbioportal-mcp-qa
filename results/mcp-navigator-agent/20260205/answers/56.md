# Question 56

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?

**Answer:**

I can help you explore MGMT promoter methylation data in glioblastoma studies on cBioPortal. Let me first find the relevant glioblastoma studies that contain this data.

Great! I found several glioblastoma studies. For exploring MGMT promoter methylation, I recommend the **"Glioblastoma (TCGA, Cell 2013)"** study (`gbm_tcga_pub2013`), which has **MGMT_STATUS** as a clinical attribute specifically tracking MGMT promoter methylation status.

Let me generate a direct link to this study where you can explore the relationship between MGMT methylation and clinical outcomes:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "gbm_tcga_pub2013"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=gbm_tcga_pub2013","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=gbm_tcga_pub2013","data":{"studyIds":["gbm_tcga_pub2013"],"studies":[{"studyId":"gbm_tcga_pub2013","name":"Glioblastoma (TCGA, Cell 2013)","sampleCount":577}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Perfect! Here's how you can explore MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastoma on cBioPortal:

## **Direct Link to Glioblastoma Study:**
**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=gbm_tcga_pub2013**

This study (Glioblastoma TCGA, Cell 2013) contains 577 samples with MGMT methylation status data.

## **How to Explore MGMT Methylation Effects:**

Once you're in the study view, you can:

1. **View MGMT Status Distribution:**
   - Look for the "MGMT Status" chart in the Clinical Data section
   - This shows the breakdown of methylated vs unmethylated cases

2. **Survival Analysis by MGMT Status:**
   - Scroll to the "Survival" section
   - Click on survival curves and select "MGMT_STATUS" as the grouping variable
   - This will show Kaplan-Meier curves comparing survival between MGMT-methylated and unmethylated patients

3. **Compare Treatment Response:**
   - Use the "Clinical Data" tab to filter by MGMT status
   - The study includes a "THERAPY" attribute that you can cross-reference with MGMT status
   - Look for differences in outcomes based on treatment received

4. **Genomic Correlations:**
   - Filter patients by MGMT status and examine associated genomic alterations
   - Check for correlations with IDH1 mutations (also tracked in this study as "IDH1_MUTATION")
   - Explore G-CIMP methylation phenotype ("G_CIMP_METHYLATION" attribute)

## **Research Context (Important Background):**

**MGMT promoter methylation is clinically significant in glioblastoma because:**

- **Prognostic Value:** MGMT-methylated tumors generally have better overall survival
- **Predictive Value:** Methylation silences the MGMT DNA repair gene, making tumors more sensitive to alkylating chemotherapy agents (particularly temozolomide)
- **Treatment Decisions:** MGMT status helps guide whether patients are likely to benefit from temozolomide therapy

**However, I must emphasize:** cBioPortal is a research tool for exploring published datasets. While it can show you population-level associations between MGMT methylation and outcomes, **I cannot provide clinical advice or interpret results for individual patient treatment decisions**. Any clinical interpretation should be done by qualified healthcare professionals.

Would you like me to help you create specific filtered views or comparisons within this dataset?
