# Question 59

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find studies that might be suitable for lncRNA exploration. Let me search for studies that could have RNA sequencing data with different library preparation methods.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "RNA",
    "sequencing"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:

Great question! You're asking about RNA sequencing library preparation methods, specifically looking for studies that used **total RNA sequencing** (ribosomal depletion) rather than **polyA enrichment**, which is important for studying long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) since many lncRNAs lack polyA tails.

Unfortunately, **cBioPortal typically doesn't include detailed library preparation metadata** (like polyA vs. ribo-depletion) in the study descriptions that are searchable through the interface. This information is usually found in the original publication's methods section.

However, here are some approaches to find suitable studies:

## 1. **Check TCGA Studies**
Many TCGA studies have **both polyA-enriched and total RNA-seq data** available. The TCGA PanCancer Atlas studies often include comprehensive RNA-seq data. For example:

- **Breast Cancer TCGA**: https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pub
- Other TCGA studies in the PanCancer Atlas collection

## 2. **Look for Studies with "Total RNA" or "Ribo-depletion" in Publications**
Some studies I found with RNA-seq data that you could investigate:

- **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (Genentech)**: https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=ccle_genentech_2014
- **Pediatric Brain Cancer (CPTAC)**: https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brain_cptac_2020

## 3. **Best Approach**
1. Browse all available studies at: **https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets**
2. For studies with RNA-seq data, check the **original publication** (linked in each study page) to find the library preparation method in the Methods section
3. Look for terms like "ribosomal depletion," "ribo-minus," or "total RNA-seq"

## 4. **Alternative Resources**
For lncRNA-specific analyses, you might also want to explore:
- **TCGA data directly from GDC** (Genomic Data Commons) where you can filter by experimental strategy
- **ENCODE** or **FANTOM** projects, which specifically focus on non-coding RNA characterization

Would you like me to help you explore any specific cancer type or study in more detail?
