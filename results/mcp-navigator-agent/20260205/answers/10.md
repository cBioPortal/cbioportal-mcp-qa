# Question 10

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What is the median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study. Let me start by finding the correct study and then accessing the clinical data.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "TARGET",
    "osteosarcoma"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["os_target_gdc"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","sampleCount":159,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["AGE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","DAYS_TO_BIRTH","DAYS_TO_DEATH","DISEASE_TYPE","ETHNICITY","MUTATION_COUNT","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS","PRIMARY_SITE_PATIENT","PROJECT_ID","RACE","SAMPLE_COUNT","SEX","SPECIMEN_TYPE","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","VITAL_STATUS"],"molecularProfileIds":["os_target_gdc_cna","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_read_counts_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mutations","os_target_gdc_rna_seq_mrna"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the TARGET Osteosarcoma study. Now let me navigate to the study view where you can see the age distribution and median age at diagnosis:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "os_target_gdc"
  ],
  "tab": "summary"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=os_target_gdc","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=os_target_gdc","data":{"studyIds":["os_target_gdc"],"studies":[{"studyId":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","sampleCount":159}],"tab":"summary","hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Here is the direct link to the TARGET Osteosarcoma study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=os_target_gdc**

This study contains **159 samples** from the TARGET Osteosarcoma (GDC, 2025) dataset.

On the Study Summary page, you'll find the age distribution in the clinical data charts. The study has an "AGE" clinical attribute that will show you the age distribution and statistics including the median age at diagnosis.

To see the detailed age statistics:
1. On the summary page, look for the "Age" chart in the clinical data section
2. The chart will display the distribution and should show the median value
3. Alternatively, you can click on the **Clinical Data** tab to see a detailed table view of all clinical attributes including age statistics

The AGE attribute is available for this cohort, and the visualization will provide you with the median and other statistical measures for age at diagnosis in these osteosarcoma patients.
