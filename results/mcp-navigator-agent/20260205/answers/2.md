# Question 2

**Type:** Study Discovery

**Question:** How many glioblastoma studies are in cBioPortal?

**Answer:**

I'll search for glioblastoma studies in cBioPortal to find out how many are available.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "glioblastoma"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 7 matching studies (showing top 5 with detailed metadata). Review the user's original query to determine if it clearly matches one study.
