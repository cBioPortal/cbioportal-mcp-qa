# Question 62

**Type:** Mutation-Associated Clinical Differences

**Question:** In the TCGA Glioblastoma multiforme study compare the median patient age at diagnosis between patients with IDH1 R132H mutation and patients with wild-type IDH1.

**Answer:**

I'll help you compare the median age at diagnosis between IDH1 R132H mutated and wild-type IDH1 patients in the TCGA Glioblastoma study. Let me start by resolving the study and then setting up the comparison.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json

  "studyKeywords": [
    "TCGA",
    "glioblastoma"

I found 5 TCGA Glioblastoma studies. For the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis, I recommend using the **PanCancer Atlas** version. However, I notice that the **Cell 2013** study has a specific `IDH1_MUTATION` clinical attribute that might be useful.

For this comparison, I'll use the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018** study as it's the most comprehensive. However, to compare IDH1 R132H mutated vs wild-type patients, I need to filter by the specific IDH1 mutation first, then compare by age. Let me create a group comparison that will show you the age distribution between these groups.



Calling `navigate_to_group_comparison` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "clinicalAttributeId": "AGE",
  "studyViewFilter": {
    "geneFilters": [
      {
        "molecularProfileIds": [
          "gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations"
        ],
        "geneQueries": [
          [
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "IDH1"
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "tab": "clinical"
}
```

Let me try a different approach. I'll create a view that filters for IDH1 mutations and then you can examine the age distribution. Let me first navigate to a StudyView with IDH1 mutations filtered:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "filterJson": {
    "geneFilters": [
      {
        "molecularProfileIds": [
          "gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations"
        ],
        "geneQueries": [
          [
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "IDH1"
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "tab": "summary"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018#filterJson={\"geneFilters\":[{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"IDH1\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations\"]}]}","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018#filterJson={\"geneFilters\":[{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"IDH1\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations\"]}]}","data":{"studyIds":["gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"],"studies":[{"studyId":"gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","name":"Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","sampleCount":592}],"tab":"summary","hasFilters":true,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


I understand you want to compare the median age between IDH1 R132H mutated and wild-type patients. Unfortunately, the group comparison tool is having technical issues. However, I can provide you with an alternative approach:

**Here's a link to view IDH1-mutated GBM patients:**
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018#filterJson={%22geneFilters%22:[{%22geneQueries%22:[[{%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22IDH1%22}]],% 22molecularProfileIds%22:[%22gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations%22]}]}

**To manually compare the median ages, here's what you can do:**

1. **View IDH1-mutated patients** (link above):
   - In the StudyView, look at the "Age" chart to see the age distribution and median age for IDH1-mutated patients

2. **View all patients** (for wild-type comparison):
   - Visit the full study: https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018
   - Look at the "Age" chart for the entire cohort

3. **For more detailed mutation-specific analysis:**
   - Go to the Mutations tab in ResultsView to see which specific IDH1 mutations (including R132H) are present
   - You can then manually calculate or compare the age distributions

**Alternative: Use the Cell 2013 study** which has a pre-computed `IDH1_MUTATION` clinical attribute that might make this comparison easier. Would you like me to explore that study instead?

I apologize that the automated group comparison isn't working as expected. The manual approach above will allow you to see the age distributions for both groups and calculate the median ages.
