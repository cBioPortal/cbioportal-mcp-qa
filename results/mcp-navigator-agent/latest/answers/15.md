# Question 15

**Type:** Data Discovery

**Question:** How many total studies contain mutation data in the cBioPortal database?

**Answer:**

I don't have a direct tool to query the total count of studies with mutation data across the entire cBioPortal database. However, I can guide you to find this information:

**Direct approach:**

Visit the cBioPortal datasets page to browse all available studies:
**https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets**

On this page, you can:
- See all studies in cBioPortal
- Filter by data type (including "Mutation data")
- View the total count of studies matching your criteria

**What you'll find:**

The datasets page provides a comprehensive table with:
- Study names and descriptions
- Sample counts
- Available data types (mutations, CNA, mRNA expression, etc.)
- Publication references

You can use the search and filter functionality to specifically identify studies containing mutation data.

**Background:**

cBioPortal contains hundreds of cancer genomics studies from various sources including:
- **TCGA** (The Cancer Genome Atlas) - ~30 cancer types
- **ICGC** (International Cancer Genome Consortium)
- **TARGET** - pediatric cancers
- **Institutional studies** (MSK-IMPACT, GENIE, etc.)
- **Cell line data** (CCLE, etc.)

Most studies include mutation data, but the exact count changes as new studies are added to the portal.

Would you like help navigating to a specific study or querying mutation data for particular genes?
