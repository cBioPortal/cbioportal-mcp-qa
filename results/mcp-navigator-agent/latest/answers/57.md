# Question 57

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?

**Answer:**

I can help you explore data on EML4-ALK fusion variants in lung cancer patients within cBioPortal. However, I need to set an important expectation first:

> **Important:** cBioPortal is a research tool for exploring cancer genomics data. While I can help you visualize fusion variants, survival data, and clinical characteristics, I cannot provide clinical advice about quality of life outcomes or predict individual patient risks. The portal primarily contains genomic and survival data, but detailed quality-of-life metrics and secondary cancer development are often not comprehensively captured in these datasets.

Let me search for relevant lung cancer studies that contain structural variant (fusion) data:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "lung",
    "ALK"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"No matching studies found","details":{"searchTerms":["lung","ALK"]}}
```


Let me try a broader search for lung cancer studies:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "lung",
    "adenocarcinoma"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json

Great! I found several lung adenocarcinoma studies. For EML4-ALK fusion analysis, I recommend studies that have **structural variant data** (which captures gene fusions). Based on the results, these studies have structural variant molecular profiles:

**Best options for EML4-ALK fusion analysis:**

1. **MSK MetTropism (MSK, Cell 2021)** - 25,775 samples with structural variants
2. **Lung Adenocarcinoma Met Organotropism (MSK, Cancer Cell 2023)** - 2,653 samples with structural variants
3. **Non-Small Cell Cancer (MSK, Cancer Discov 2017)** - 915 samples with structural variants
4. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (MSK, J Thorac Oncol 2020)** - 604 samples with structural variants

Let me create a view for you to explore EML4-ALK fusions. I'll use the largest MSK study which is most likely to have ALK fusion data:



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_met_2021"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "EML4",
    "ALK"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=msk_met_2021&gene_list=EML4+ALK&case_set_id=msk_met_2021_all","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=msk_met_2021&gene_list=EML4+ALK&case_set_id=msk_met_2021_all","data":{"studyIds":["msk_met_2021"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_met_2021","name":"MSK MetTropism (MSK, Cell 2021)","sampleCount":25775}],"genes":["EML4","ALK"],"caseSetId":"msk_met_2021_all","molecularProfiles":["msk_met_2021_mutations"]}}
```


Perfect! Here's your direct link to explore EML4-ALK alterations in lung cancer:

**🔗 [View EML4-ALK Alterations in MSK MetTropism Study](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results?cancer_study_list=msk_met_2021&gene_list=EML4+ALK&case_set_id=msk_met_2021_all)**

This will show you:
- **OncoPrint view** of EML4 and ALK alterations including fusions
- **Structural Variants tab** where you can see specific fusion variants (e.g., EML4-ALK variant 1, variant 3a/b, etc.)
- **Survival tab** to compare outcomes between patients with different alterations

## Additional Study Options:

For more focused lung adenocarcinoma cohorts with fusion data:

1. **[Lung Adenocarcinoma Met Organotropism (MSK, 2023)](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=luad_mskcc_2023_met_organotropism)** - 2,653 samples, includes metastatic site tracking
2. **[Non-Small Cell Cancer (MSK, 2017)](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=lung_msk_2017)** - 915 samples with treatment response data

---

## Important Limitations Regarding Your Question:

**What you CAN explore in cBioPortal:**
- ✅ Presence of different EML4-ALK fusion variants
- ✅ Overall survival and progression-free survival data
- ✅ Co-occurring genomic alterations
- ✅ Treatment information (in some studies)

**What is typically NOT available:**
- ❌ **Quality of life metrics** - These are rarely captured in genomic databases
- ❌ **Secondary cancer development** - Limited longitudinal data on second malignancies
- ❌ **Variant-specific long-term outcomes** - Sample sizes for individual fusion variants may be too small for robust statistical analysis

**Research Context:** While EML4-ALK fusions are well-characterized as targetable alterations (responsive to ALK inhibitors like crizotinib, alectinib, etc.), the specific impact of different fusion variants (e.g., variant 1 vs variant 3) on quality of life and secondary cancer risk would require dedicated clinical trial data or long-term follow-up studies, which may not be fully represented in these genomic databases.

Would you like me to help you explore a specific study or look at survival data for ALK-altered patients?
