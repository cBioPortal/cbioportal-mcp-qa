# Question 50

**Type:** Pathway Enrichment

**Question:** "Are mutations in DNA repair pathway genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2) enriched in specific cancer types across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze DNA repair pathway gene mutations across cancer types in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas. Let me start by finding the appropriate study and then set up the analysis.

Perfect! I found 32 individual cancer type studies from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas. To analyze DNA repair pathway genes across all cancer types, I'll create a cross-study query that includes all 32 studies. This will allow you to see the **Cancer Types Summary** tab, which shows mutation enrichment across different cancer types.

## What You'll See:

This cross-study query spans **10,881 samples across 32 cancer types** and includes:

### Key Tabs to Explore:

1. **OncoPrint Tab** (default view)
   - Visual matrix showing mutation patterns for BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2 across all samples
   - Color-coded by alteration type (mutations, amplifications, deletions)

2. **Cancer Types Summary Tab** ⭐ **Most relevant for your question**
   - Shows mutation frequency for each gene **by cancer type**
   - Identifies which cancer types have the highest enrichment of DNA repair gene mutations
   - Provides statistical comparison across cancer types

3. **Mutations Tab**
   - Detailed mutation information including amino acid changes
   - Lollipop plots showing mutation hotspots
   - Functional impact predictions

4. **Comparison Tab**
   - Compare samples with vs. without DNA repair gene alterations
   - Survival analysis by mutation status

---

## Expected Findings:

Based on known biology, you should see enrichment of these DNA repair genes in:
- **Ovarian cancer** (BRCA1/BRCA2)
- **Breast cancer** (BRCA1/BRCA2)
- **Uterine endometrial cancer** (DNA repair pathway defects)
- **Colorectal cancer**
