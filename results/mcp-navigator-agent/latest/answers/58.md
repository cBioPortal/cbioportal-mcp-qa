# Question 58

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Gene Alteration

**Question:** In the “Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes” study what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze the survival differences between these two patient groups in the Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes study. Let me start by finding the correct study and then set up the comparison.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "pan-cancer",
    "whole genomes"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json

Perfect! I found the study: **Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes (ICGC/TCGA, Nature 2020)** with 2,922 samples.

To answer your question about survival differences between:
- **Group 1:** Patients with mutations in BOTH TP53 AND KRAS
- **Group 2:** Patients with ONLY KRAS mutations (but NOT TP53)

I need to create two separate filtered views and then you can compare their survival curves. Let me generate the URLs for both groups:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "pancan_pcawg_2020"
  ],
  "filterJson": {
    "geneFilters": [
      {
        "molecularProfileIds": [
          "pancan_pcawg_2020_mutations"
        ],
        "geneQueries": [
          [
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "TP53"
            },
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "KRAS"
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Excellent! I've created the filtered views for both patient groups. Here's how to analyze the survival differences:

## **Group 1: Patients with BOTH TP53 AND KRAS mutations**
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=pancan_pcawg_2020#filterJson={%22geneFilters%22:[{%22geneQueries%22:[[{%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22TP53%22},{%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22KRAS%22}],%22molecularProfileIds%22:[%22pancan_pcawg_2020_mutations%22]}]}

## **Group 2: Patients with KRAS mutations (includes both KRAS-only and TP53+KRAS)**
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=pancan_pcawg_2020#filterJson={%22geneFilters%22:[{%22geneQueries%22:[[{%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22KRAS%22}]],%22molecularProfileIds%22:[%22pancan_pcawg_2020_mutations%22]}]}

## **How to compare survival:**

1. **Open Group 1 link** (TP53+KRAS) and look at the survival chart on the Summary tab. Note the median survival and number of patients.

2. **Open Group 2 link** (all KRAS) and do the same.

3. **To get KRAS-only patients** (excluding TP53+KRAS), you'll need to manually identify the difference between these two groups, or use the Comparison feature.

4. **For statistical significance:** Once you view the survival curves in each filtered view, cBioPortal displays the log-rank test p-value on the survival plot.

## **Alternative approach for direct comparison:**

For a more direct statistical comparison, I recommend:
1. Open the **Group 2 link** (all KRAS mutations)
2. In the Study View, use the "Comparison" feature to create two groups based on TP53 mutation status
3. Navigate to the Survival tab in the Comparison view to see the Kaplan-Meier curves side-by-side with the log-rank p-value

This will give you the exact survival difference and statistical significance (p-value) between TP53+KRAS versus KRAS-only patients.
