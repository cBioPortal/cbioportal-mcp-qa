# Question 40

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the most frequently altered genes in KRAS wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most frequently altered genes in KRAS wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients. Let me start by identifying the appropriate lung adenocarcinoma study and then navigate to a filtered view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "lung",
    "adenocarcinoma",
    "TCGA"
  ]
}
```

Perfect! I found several TCGA lung adenocarcinoma studies. I'll use the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018** version as it's the most comprehensive and up-to-date. Now let me create a filtered view showing only KRAS wild-type patients, which will allow you to see the most frequently altered genes in that subset.



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "filterJson": {
    "geneFilters": [
      {
        "molecularProfileIds": [
          "luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations"
        ],
        "geneQueries": [
          [
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "KRAS"
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json

I apologize - I created a filter for KRAS-mutated patients, but you need KRAS wild-type (non-mutated) patients. Unfortunately, cBioPortal's filtering system doesn't have a direct "exclude" or "wild-type" filter option through the URL parameters.

However, here's how you can find the most frequently altered genes in KRAS wild-type patients:

## Approach 1: Manual Filtering (Recommended)

**Step 1:** View all patients in the study:
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018

**Step 2:** Once on the Study View page:
1. Look at the **"Mutated Genes"** table on the summary tab
2. Click on the KRAS row in the mutations table
3. This will select KRAS-mutated samples
4. Click the **"Invert selection"** button or use the filter controls to exclude these samples
5. The remaining samples will be KRAS wild-type
6. The "Mutated Genes" table will automatically update to show the most frequently altered genes in KRAS wild-type patients

## Approach 2: View KRAS-mutated patients first

Here's the link to KRAS-mutated patients (about 30-35% of lung adenocarcinoma):
https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018#filterJson={%22geneFilters%22:[{%22geneQueries%22:[[{%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22KRAS%22}],%22molecularProfileIds%22:[%22luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations%22]}]}

From the full study view, you can mentally compare which genes are enriched in the wild-type population.

## Expected Biology

Based on lung adenocarcinoma biology, in KRAS wild-type patients you would typically expect to see higher frequencies of:
- **EGFR** mutations (mutually exclusive with KRAS)
- **ALK** fusions
- **ROS1** fusions  
- **BRAF** mutations
- **MET** alterations
- **RET** fusions
- **TP53** mutations (present in both groups but patterns differ)

Would you like me to generate a different view or help you explore specific genes in this cohort?
