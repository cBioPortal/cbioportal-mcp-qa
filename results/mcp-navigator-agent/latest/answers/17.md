# Question 17

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What are the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites in the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me start by resolving the study and then navigating to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the MSK-CHORD study. Now let me navigate to the StudyView to see the primary diagnosis site distribution.



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ],
  "tab": "summary"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=msk_chord_2024","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=msk_chord_2024","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"tab":"summary","hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Great! Now let me get the specific values for the PRIMARY_SITE clinical attribute to see the distribution of primary diagnosis sites:



Calling `get_clinical_attribute_values` with args:
```json
{
  "studyId": "msk_chord_2024",
  "attributeIds": [
    "PRIMARY_SITE"
  ]
}
```



Result from `get_clinical_attribute_values`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Successfully retrieved clinical attribute values","data":{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","attributes":[{"attributeId":"PRIMARY_SITE","displayName":"Primary Tumor Site","description":"The organ sub-division term assigned to the primary tumor location of the sample. Source: MPath","datatype":"STRING","values":["Transverse Colon","descending colon","prostate","Rectosigmoid Colon","Ascending colon","lung","Lung - right upper","Rectum,Colon","Skin","breast","Hepatic Flexure","Bile Duct","Left colon","Descending Colon","Small Intestine","Transverse colon","Bowel","Hepatic flexure","Anus","Prostate","Rectum","Unknown","Pancreas","cecum","Colon","Rectosigmoid Colon,Bowel","Lung","Sigmoid colon","Breast","Ascending Colon","Cecum","colon","Sigmoid Colon","Chest Wall","Kidney"]}]}}
```


I can see the PRIMARY_SITE attribute has many values, but the tool returns them in an unordered list without counts. To see the actual distribution with sample counts for the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites, you'll need to view the study directly in cBioPortal where the charts will show the frequency distribution.

**Here is the direct link to the MSK-CHORD Study:**

https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=msk_chord_2024

Once you open this link, look for the **"Primary Tumor Site"** chart on the summary page. This chart will display the distribution of all primary diagnosis sites with sample counts, allowing you to identify the top 5 most common sites.

Based on the MSK-CHORD study (Nature 2024) which includes 25,040 samples across multiple cancer types, the primary sites visible in the data include:
- Prostate
- Breast  
- Lung
- Colon (including various colon subsites)
- Pancreas
- Kidney
- Rectum

The interactive chart in the StudyView will show you the exact sample counts and percentages for each primary site, making it easy to identify the top 5.
