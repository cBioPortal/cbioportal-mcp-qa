# Question 30

**Type:** Copy Number Expression Correlation

**Question:** Is CDK4 mRNA expression significantly higher in samples with CDK4 amplification compared to diploid samples?

**Answer:**

I'll help you investigate whether CDK4 mRNA expression is significantly higher in samples with CDK4 amplification compared to diploid samples. To do this, we need to first identify a suitable study and then navigate to a view where we can analyze this relationship.

Let me start by finding relevant studies that would have both CDK4 copy number and expression data:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json

    "pan_can_atlas"

Perfect! I found multiple PanCancer Atlas studies. To answer your question about CDK4 amplification and mRNA expression correlation, the best approach is to use the **Plots tab** in StudyView, which allows you to create scatter plots comparing copy number alterations (CNA) with mRNA expression.

Since you didn't specify a particular cancer type, I'll use **Glioblastoma (GBM)** as an example, as CDK4 amplification is particularly common in this cancer type. However, you can apply the same approach to any of the PanCancer Atlas studies.

Let me generate a direct link to the Plots tab configured to show CDK4 copy number vs. CDK4 mRNA expression:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "tab": "plots",
  "plotsHorzSelection": {
    "dataType": "COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION",
    "selectedGeneOption": "CDK4"
  },
  "plotsVertSelection": {
    "dataType": "MRNA_EXPRESSION",
    "selectedGeneOption": "CDK4"
  }
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json

Excellent! Here's your direct link to analyze the relationship between CDK4 amplification and mRNA expression:

## **[View CDK4 Copy Number vs. mRNA Expression in Glioblastoma](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=gbm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&plots_horz_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22CDK4%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION%22%7D&plots_vert_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22CDK4%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22MRNA_EXPRESSION%22%7D)**

This plot shows:
- **X-axis:** CDK4 copy number alteration (where amplifications will appear on the right side)
- **Y-axis:** CDK4 mRNA expression levels

**What to look for:**
- Samples with **amplification** (AMP, typically shown as +2 on the copy number scale) should cluster toward the upper right if expression is significantly higher
- Samples with **diploid** copy number (0) will be in the middle of the x-axis
- The plot will show you the correlation and allow you to visually assess whether amplified samples have significantly higher expression

**To perform statistical analysis:**
- cBioPortal will display correlation statistics (Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value) on the plot
- You can also use the comparison tools to formally test differences between groups

**Want to explore other cancer types?** CDK4 amplification is also common in:
- **Sarcoma** - [View in Sarcoma](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=sarc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018)
- **Breast Cancer** - [View in Breast Cancer](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018)
- **Lung Adenocarcinoma** - [View in Lung Adenocarcinoma](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018)

Just let me know which cancer type you'd like to explore, and I can generate the specific plot for that study!
