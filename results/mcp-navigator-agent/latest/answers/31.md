# Question 31

**Type:** Cross-Cancer Mutation Frequency

**Question:** Which cancer types have the highest frequency of EGFR mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the EGFR mutation frequencies across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies. Let me start by identifying the relevant Pan-Cancer Atlas studies.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",

    "pan_can_atlas",
    "TCGA"

```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:

Perfect! I found all 32 TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies. Now let me create a cross-study query for EGFR mutations across all these cancer types. This will allow you to see which cancer types have the highest EGFR mutation frequencies.

## What You'll See:

This cross-study query includes **all 32 cancer types** from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas (10,967 total samples), allowing you to compare EGFR mutation frequencies across different cancer types.

### How to Find the Highest Frequency Cancer Types:

1. **OncoPrint View**: The default view shows the mutation pattern across all samples
2. **Cancer Types Summary Tab**: Click this tab to see a breakdown of EGFR alteration frequencies by cancer type - this will directly answer your question about which cancer types have the highest EGFR mutation rates
3. **Mutations Tab**: View specific mutation details and hotspots

### Expected High-Frequency Cancer Types:

Based on published literature, you should expect to see the highest EGFR mutation frequencies in:
- **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** - typically 10-15% mutation rate
- **Glioblastoma (GBM)** - EGFR amplifications and mutations are common
- **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC)** - moderate frequency
- **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD)** - lower but notable frequency

The **Cancer Types Summary** tab will give you the exact percentages for each cancer type in this dataset.
