# Question 44

**Type:** Hypermutation Phenotype

**Question:** What percentage of endometrial cancer samples have hypermutation (>5000 mutations) and how does this correlate with histological subtype?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore hypermutation rates in endometrial cancer and their correlation with histological subtypes. Let me start by finding the appropriate endometrial cancer study.

Great! I found several endometrial cancer studies. For your analysis of hypermutation rates and correlation with histological subtypes, I recommend the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas** study as it has comprehensive mutation data and clinical annotations including histological information.

Let me navigate to this study and set up a view that will help you explore mutation burden and histological subtypes:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "tab": "summary"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","data":{"studyIds":["ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"],"studies":[{"studyId":"ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","name":"Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","sampleCount":529}],"tab":"summary","hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Perfect! Here's your direct link to the **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018**

This study contains **529 samples** with comprehensive mutation data and clinical annotations.

## How to Analyze Hypermutation and Histological Correlation:

### Step 1: Identify Hypermutated Samples
Once on the study page, you can:
1. Look for the **Mutation Count** chart in the summary view
2. Use the **Plots tab** to create a scatter plot or histogram of mutation counts
3. Filter samples with >5000 mutations using the mutation count filter

### Step 2: Correlate with Histological Subtype
The study has several relevant clinical attributes:
- **HISTOLOGICAL_SUBTYPE** or **CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED** for histology information
- **SUBTYPE** for molecular classification
- **GRADE** for tumor grade

### Recommended Analysis Approach:

**Option A - Use the Plots Tab:**
- Navigate to the **Plots** tab
- Set X-axis to "Mutation Count" 
- Color by "Histological Subtype" or "Grade"
- This will show you the distribution visually

**Option B - Use Filters:**
- Filter for samples with MUTATION_COUNT > 5000
- Then examine the distribution of histological subtypes in the filtered cohort

### Known Context about Endometrial Cancer:
Endometrial cancers are known to have distinct molecular subtypes with varying mutation burdens:
- **Ultramutated/Hypermutated** tumors (often POLE-mutated or MSI-high) can have >1000 mutations
- **Endometrioid** histology tends to have higher mutation rates than serous
- **MSI status** strongly correlates with hypermutation

The TCGA PanCancer Atlas study includes MSI scores (MSI_SCORE_MANTIS, MSI_SENSOR_SCORE) which you can also correlate with mutation burden.

Would you like me to create a specific filtered view or help you navigate to the Plots tab for this analysis?
