# Question 48

**Type:** Multi-omic Integration

**Question:** "What is the concordance between ERBB2 copy number amplification, mRNA overexpression, and protein overexpression in breast cancer?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the concordance between ERBB2 (HER2) copy number amplification, mRNA overexpression, and protein overexpression in breast cancer. Let me start by finding the appropriate breast cancer study.

Perfect! I found several TCGA breast cancer studies. For your question about ERBB2 concordance across multiple data types (copy number, mRNA, and protein), I recommend using the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018** study as it has comprehensive multi-omic data including:
- Copy number alterations (CNA/GISTIC)
- mRNA expression (RNA-seq)
- Protein expression (RPPA - Reverse Phase Protein Array)

The best way to visualize concordance between these data types is through the **Plots tab** in StudyView, where you can create scatter plots comparing different molecular data types for ERBB2.

Let me generate the direct link to the study:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json

  "studyIds": [
    "brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"

  },
  "plotsVertSelection": {

  }

Excellent! Here's your direct link to explore ERBB2 concordance in breast cancer:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&plots_horz_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22ERBB2%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION%22%2C%22selectedDataSourceOption%22%3A%22brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_gistic%22%7D&plots_vert_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22ERBB2%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22mrna%22%2C%22selectedDataSourceOption%22%3A%22brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_rna_seq_v2_mrna%22%7D**

This link opens the **Plots tab** in the TCGA Breast Cancer PanCancer Atlas study (1,084 samples) with:
- **X-axis:** ERBB2 copy number alteration (amplification/deletion)
- **Y-axis:** ERBB2 mRNA expression

## How to explore concordance:

1. **CNA vs mRNA (already configured):** The link above shows the correlation between copy number and mRNA expression. You'll see if amplifications correlate with overexpression.

2. **To add protein data:** Once on the page, you can change one axis to protein expression:
   - Click on the axis configuration
   - Select "Protein Level (RPPA)" as the data type
   - Choose "ERBB2" (or "HER2" if available in the RPPA data)

3. **Color by alteration type:** Use the coloring options to highlight samples with:
   - Copy number amplifications (red)
   - This helps visualize which amplified samples show mRNA/protein overexpression

4. **View statistics:** The plot will show correlation coefficients (Spearman/Pearson) to quantify concordance.

## Key insights you can derive:
- **High concordance:** Amplifications typically drive mRNA overexpression
- **Discordance cases:** Some samples may have amplification without proportional mRNA/protein increase (post-transcriptional regulation)
- **HER2-positive subtype:** Typically shows high ERBB2 amplification + overexpression

Would you like me to help you create additional visualizations or filter for specific patient subgroups?
