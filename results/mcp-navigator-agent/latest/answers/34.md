# Question 34

**Type:** Protein Expression Correlation

**Question:** What is the correlation between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels in ovarian cancer samples?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the correlation between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels in ovarian cancer. Let me start by finding the appropriate ovarian cancer study.

Great! I found several ovarian cancer studies. For exploring the correlation between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels, I recommend the **Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study, as it has both:
- mRNA expression data (RNA-seq)
- Protein quantification data (RPPA - Reverse Phase Protein Array)

This study has 585 samples and is the most comprehensive TCGA ovarian cancer dataset. Let me navigate you to the Plots tab where you can visualize the correlation between EGFR mRNA and protein levels:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "tab": "plots",
  "plotsHorzSelection": {
    "dataType": "MRNA_EXPRESSION",
    "selectedGeneOption": "EGFR",
    "selectedDataSourceOption": "rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores"
  },
  "plotsVertSelection": {
    "dataType": "PROTEIN_LEVEL",
    "selectedGeneOption": "EGFR",
    "selectedDataSourceOption": "rppa_Zscores"
  }
}
```

Perfect! Here's your direct link to explore the correlation between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels in ovarian cancer:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&plots_horz_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22EGFR%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22MRNA_EXPRESSION%22%2C%22selectedDataSourceOption%22%3A%22rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores%22%7D&plots_vert_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22EGFR%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22PROTEIN_LEVEL%22%2C%22selectedDataSourceOption%22%3A%22rppa_Zscores%22%7D**

This link takes you to the **Plots tab** of the TCGA Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma PanCancer Atlas study (585 samples) with:
- **X-axis:** EGFR mRNA expression (RNA-seq z-scores)
- **Y-axis:** EGFR protein levels (RPPA z-scores)

The scatter plot will show you the correlation between mRNA and protein levels for EGFR across all samples. The plot will display:
- Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients
- Individual data points for each sample
- Regression line showing the relationship

**Note:** RPPA (Reverse Phase Protein Array) data is available for a subset of samples, so you'll see correlation based on samples with both mRNA and protein measurements.

If you'd like to explore other ovarian cancer studies with different data types, let me know!
