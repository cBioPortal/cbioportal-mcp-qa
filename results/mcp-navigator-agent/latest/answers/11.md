# Question 11

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me first resolve the study and then navigate you to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the MSK-CHORD Study (MSK, Nature 2024) with 25,040 samples. Now let me navigate you to the StudyView where you can see the most frequently mutated genes.



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ],
  "tab": "summary"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=msk_chord_2024","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=msk_chord_2024","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"tab":"summary","hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


**Here is the direct link to the MSK-CHORD Study:**

https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/summary?id=msk_chord_2024

On the **Summary tab** of the StudyView, you'll find a chart showing the **"Mutated Genes"** which displays the most frequently mutated genes in this cohort of 25,040 samples. This chart typically shows the top mutated genes ranked by frequency, allowing you to identify the top 5 most frequently mutated genes.

The MSK-CHORD study is a large pan-cancer study from Memorial Sloan Kettering published in Nature 2024, covering multiple cancer types including lung, breast, prostate, and others.
