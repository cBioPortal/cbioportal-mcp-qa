# Question 52

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most frequent TP53 mutation in the TCGA breast cancer study. Let me start by resolving the study and then navigating to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "TCGA",
    "breast"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 6 matching studies (showing top 5 with detailed metadata). Review the user's original query to determine if it clearly matches one study.

I found several TCGA breast cancer studies. For the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis, I recommend using the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018** version, which has 1,084 samples. Let me navigate to the TP53 mutations view for this study.



Calling `navigate_to_resultsview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "genes": [
    "TP53"
  ],
  "tab": "mutations"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_resultsview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/mutations?cancer_study_list=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&gene_list=TP53&case_set_id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/mutations?cancer_study_list=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&gene_list=TP53&case_set_id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all","data":{"studyIds":["brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"],"studies":[{"studyId":"brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","name":"Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","sampleCount":1084}],"genes":["TP53"],"caseSetId":"brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all","molecularProfiles":["brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_mutations"]}}
```


Perfect! Here is the direct link to view TP53 mutations in the TCGA Breast Cancer PanCancer Atlas study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/results/mutations?cancer_study_list=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&gene_list=TP53&case_set_id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all**

This link will take you to the **Mutations tab** where you can see:

1. **Mutation frequency** - The overall percentage of samples with TP53 mutations
2. **Lollipop plot** - Visual representation showing the most frequent mutation positions along the TP53 protein
3. **Mutation table** - Detailed list of all TP53 mutations sorted by frequency, showing:
   - Specific amino acid changes (e.g., R175H, R248Q, R273H)
   - Number of samples with each mutation
   - Mutation type (missense, nonsense, frameshift, etc.)
   - Functional impact predictions

The most frequent mutations will appear at the top of the table and as the tallest "lollipops" in the diagram. In breast cancer, TP53 mutations are commonly found in hotspot regions, particularly in the DNA-binding domain (codons 175, 248, 273, etc.).

**Note:** This study contains 1,084 breast cancer samples from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas, which is the most comprehensive TCGA breast cancer dataset.
