# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently altered genes in a structural variant in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study. Let me start by identifying the correct study.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "TARGET",
    "osteosarcoma"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["os_target_gdc"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","sampleCount":159,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["AGE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","DAYS_TO_BIRTH","DAYS_TO_DEATH","DISEASE_TYPE","ETHNICITY","MUTATION_COUNT","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS","PRIMARY_SITE_PATIENT","PROJECT_ID","RACE","SAMPLE_COUNT","SEX","SPECIMEN_TYPE","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","VITAL_STATUS"],"molecularProfileIds":["os_target_gdc_cna","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_read_counts_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm","os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm_Zscores","os_target_gdc_mutations","os_target_gdc_rna_seq_mrna"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc). Now let me navigate to the study view where you can explore structural variant data.



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "os_target_gdc"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc","data":{"studyIds":["os_target_gdc"],"studies":[{"studyId":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","sampleCount":159}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Here is the direct link to the **TARGET Osteosarcoma (GDC, 2025)** study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=os_target_gdc**

This study contains 159 samples. To find the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants:

1. **Navigate to the study view** using the link above
2. **Look for the "Structural Variants" chart** in the genomic overview section - this will show you the most frequently altered genes in structural variants (fusions/rearrangements)
3. The chart typically displays genes ranked by frequency of structural variant alterations

**Note:** Based on the molecular profile metadata, I don't see a specific structural variant profile listed for this study. This could mean:
- Structural variant data may not be available for this particular dataset
- The data might be included within another data type
- You may need to check the study page directly to confirm data availability

If structural variant data is not available in this study, you might want to explore:
- The **Mutations tab** for point mutations and small indels
- The **Copy Number Alterations (CNA)** data which is available (os_target_gdc_cna profile)

Would you like me to help you explore other types of genomic alterations in this osteosarcoma study?
