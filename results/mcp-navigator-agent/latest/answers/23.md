# Question 23

**Type:** Clinical Data Correlation Analysis

**Question:** What is the correlation between tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability status in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the correlation between tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD study.

Let me start by finding the correct study and then navigate you to the appropriate view.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD",
    "colorectal"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"No matching studies found","details":{"searchTerms":["MSK-CHORD","colorectal"]}}
```


Let me try a broader search for MSK-CHORD:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Perfect! I found the MSK-CHORD study. I can see that this study has both **MSI_TYPE** and **TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS** as clinical attributes, which is exactly what you need to explore the correlation.

To visualize the correlation between TMB and MSI status in colorectal cancer patients, I'll navigate you to the **Plots tab** in StudyView, where you can create a scatter plot or box plot. However, I first need to filter for colorectal cancer patients only.

Let me check what cancer types are available and get the exact values:



Calling `get_clinical_attribute_values` with args:
```json
{
  "studyId": "msk_chord_2024",
  "attributeIds": [
    "CANCER_TYPE",
    "CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED"
  ]
}
```



Result from `get_clinical_attribute_values`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Successfully retrieved clinical attribute values","data":{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","attributes":[{"attributeId":"CANCER_TYPE","displayName":"Cancer Type","description":"The main cancer type as defined by the Oncotree cancer classification system for precision oncology.

Excellent! I can see "Colorectal Cancer" is available as a cancer type. Now let me create a filtered view for colorectal cancer patients and navigate you to the Plots tab where you can visualize the TMB vs MSI correlation:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ],
  "tab": "plots",
  "filterJson": {
    "clinicalDataFilters": [
      {
        "attributeId": "CANCER_TYPE",
        "values": [
          {
            "value": "Colorectal Cancer"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "plotsHorzSelection": {
    "selectedDataSourceOption": "MSI_TYPE",
    "dataType": "clinical_attribute"
  },
  "plotsVertSelection": {
    "selectedDataSourceOption": "TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS",
    "dataType": "clinical_attribute"
  }
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:

Perfect! Here's your direct link to explore the correlation between TMB and MSI status in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD study:

**🔗 [View TMB vs MSI Status Plot for Colorectal Cancer Patients](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=msk_chord_2024&plots_horz_selection=%7B%22dataType%22%3A%22clinical_attribute%22%2C%22selectedDataSourceOption%22%3A%22MSI_TYPE%22%7D&plots_vert_selection=%7B%22dataType%22%3A%22clinical_attribute%22%2C%22selectedDataSourceOption%22%3A%22TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS%22%7D#filterJson={%22clinicalDataFilters%22:[{%22attributeId%22:%22CANCER_TYPE%22,%22values%22:[{%22value%22:%22Colorectal%20Cancer%22}]}]})**

## What This Shows:

This link takes you to the **Plots tab** in StudyView with:
- **Filtered cohort:** Only colorectal cancer patients from MSK-CHORD (Nature 2024)
- **X-axis:** MSI_TYPE (Microsatellite Instability Status)
- **Y-axis:** TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS (Tumor Mutational Burden - nonsynonymous mutations)

## What You'll See:

The plot will display the relationship between MSI status and TMB. Typically, you would expect:
- **MSI-High (MSI-H)** tumors to have significantly elevated TMB
- **Microsatellite Stable (MSS)** tumors to have lower TMB
- This is a well-established correlation in colorectal cancer biology

## Additional Analysis Options:

Once on the page, you can:
1. **Switch plot types** using the controls (box plot, scatter plot, etc.)
2. **View statistics** and perform statistical tests
3. **Download the data** for further analysis
4. **Explore other clinical attributes** by changing the axis selections

The MSK-CHORD study contains 25,040 total samples across multiple cancer types, making it an excellent resource for this type of analysis.
