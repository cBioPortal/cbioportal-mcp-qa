# Question 42

**Type:** Co-occurring Mutations

**Question:** What percentage of endometrial cancer patients have co-occurring oncogenic mutations in both KRAS and NRAS?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the co-occurrence of oncogenic mutations in KRAS and NRAS in endometrial cancer patients. Let me start by finding the appropriate endometrial cancer study.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "endometrial"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"Bad Gateway","details":{"status":502,"response":{"req":{"method":"POST","url":"https://www.cbioportal.org/api/clinical-attributes/fetch?projection=SUMMARY","data":["ucec_ancestry_cds_msk_2023"],"headers":{"user-agent":"node-superagent/3.8.3","accept":"application/json","content-type":"application/json"}},"header":{"date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:46:32 GMT","content-type":"text/html","content-length":"150","connection":"close","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"},"status":502,"text":"<html>\r\n<head><title>502 Bad Gateway</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"}}}
```


Let me try again with the router:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "results",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "endometrial"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"Service Unavailable","details":{"status":503,"response":{"req":{"method":"POST","url":"https://www.cbioportal.org/api/molecular-profiles/fetch?projection=ID","data":{"studyIds":["ucec_tcga"]},"headers":{"user-agent":"node-superagent/3.8.3","accept":"application/json","content-type":"application/json"}},"header":{"date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:46:38 GMT","content-type":"text/html","content-length":"190","connection":"close","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"},"status":503,"text":"<html>\r\n<head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"}}}
```


I'm encountering temporary service issues with the cBioPortal API. However, I can still help you with your question about KRAS and NRAS co-occurrence in endometrial cancer.

Based on the typical endometrial cancer studies available in cBioPortal (such as the TCGA Endometrial Cancer studies), I can guide you to find this information:

**Direct approach to answer your question:**

1. **Navigate to the TCGA Endometrial Cancer study** - The main study is "Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)" with study ID `ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`

2. **Query both KRAS and NRAS** to see their co-occurrence pattern

Once the service is back online, you would access:
**https://www.cbioportal.org/results/oncoprint?cancer_study_list=ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&gene_list=KRAS%20NRAS&case_set_id=ucec_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_all**

**What to look for in the results:**
- The **OncoPrint** will show you which samples have mutations in KRAS, NRAS, or both
- The **Mutual Exclusivity tab** will show statistical analysis of co-occurrence vs. mutual exclusivity
- Look for samples with alterations in BOTH genes simultaneously

**Important note about KRAS and NRAS:**
In most cancer types, KRAS and NRAS mutations are typically **mutually exclusive** because they both activate the same RAS/MAPK pathway. Co-occurring oncogenic mutations in both genes are quite rare. However, endometrial cancer can have high mutation rates, so it's worth checking.

Please try accessing the link above, or wait a few moments and I can retry the query for you. Would you like me to try again?
