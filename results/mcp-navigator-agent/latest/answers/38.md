# Question 38

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Expression

**Question:** Do lung adenocarcinoma patients with high EGFR mRNA expression (top quartile) have different survival outcomes than those with low expression?

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze survival outcomes for lung adenocarcinoma patients based on EGFR mRNA expression levels. Let me start by finding the appropriate study.

I found 19 lung adenocarcinoma studies. For survival analysis based on EGFR mRNA expression quartiles, I recommend the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas** study as it has comprehensive mRNA expression data and survival information. Let me create a comparison for you.

However, I need to clarify: cBioPortal's group comparison tool can automatically create quartile groups for numerical data like mRNA expression. Let me set this up by first navigating to the study with EGFR expression data and creating a visualization.

Actually, for comparing survival outcomes based on EGFR mRNA expression quartiles (top vs bottom), the best approach in cBioPortal is to use the **Plots tab** in StudyView where you can:
1. Plot EGFR expression vs survival
2. Color by expression quartiles
3. Perform survival analysis

Let me generate the direct link to the TCGA PanCancer Atlas study with the Plots tab configured for EGFR expression analysis:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "tab": "plots",
  "plotsHorzSelection": {
    "selectedGeneOption": "EGFR",
    "dataType": "mRNA"
  }
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&plots_horz_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22EGFR%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22mRNA%22%7D","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&plots_horz_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22EGFR%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22mRNA%22%7D","data":{"studyIds":["luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"],"studies":[{"studyId":"luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","name":"Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","sampleCount":566}],"tab":"plots","hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":true}}
```


Perfect! Here's your direct link to analyze EGFR mRNA expression and survival in lung adenocarcinoma:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&plots_horz_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22EGFR%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22mRNA%22%7D**

This opens the **Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study with 566 samples in the Plots tab with EGFR mRNA expression pre-configured.

## To answer your survival question, follow these steps:

1. **In the Plots tab** (where the link takes you):
   - Set the **X-axis** to "EGFR" mRNA expression (already configured)
   - Set the **Y-axis** to a survival outcome (e.g., "Overall Survival (Months)" or "OS_MONTHS")
   
2. **Create quartile groups**:
   - Click on the plot settings
   - You can bin the EGFR expression data into quartiles
   - This will separate patients into 4 groups: bottom 25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and top 25%

3. **Generate survival curves**:
   - After binning, you can click to generate Kaplan-Meier survival curves
   - This will show you if the top quartile (high EGFR expression) has different survival compared to the bottom quartile (low expression)

**Alternative approach** - If you want to directly compare just the top vs bottom quartiles, you could also use the **Results View** with EGFR and navigate to the Survival tab, where you can stratify by expression levels.

Would you like me to generate an alternative link that goes directly to a gene-focused analysis with survival stratification?
