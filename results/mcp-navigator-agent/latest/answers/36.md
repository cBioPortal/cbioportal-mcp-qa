Perfect! I found several ovarian cancer studies. For your question about BRCA1 promoter methylation and mRNA expression correlation, I recommend the **Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study, as it has both methylation data and mRNA expression data available.

To explore the relationship between BRCA1 promoter methylation and BRCA1 mRNA expression, you'll want to use the **Plots tab** in StudyView, which allows you to create scatter plots comparing different molecular data types.



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "tab": "plots",
  "plotsHorzSelection": {
    "selectedGeneOption": "BRCA1",
    "dataType": "methylation",
    "selectedDataSourceOption": "ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_methylation_hm27_hm450_merge"
  },
  "plotsVertSelection": {
    "selectedGeneOption": "BRCA1",
    "dataType": "MRNA_EXPRESSION",
    "selectedDataSourceOption": "ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores"
  }
}
```

Excellent! Here's the direct link to explore the relationship between BRCA1 promoter methylation and BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018&plots_horz_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22BRCA1%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22methylation%22%2C%22selectedDataSourceOption%22%3A%22ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_methylation_hm27_hm450_merge%22%7D&plots_vert_selection=%7B%22selectedGeneOption%22%3A%22BRCA1%22%2C%22dataType%22%3A%22MRNA_EXPRESSION%22%2C%22selectedDataSourceOption%22%3A%22ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores%22%7D**

This link opens the **Plots tab** in the Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) study with:
- **X-axis:** BRCA1 promoter methylation levels
- **Y-axis:** BRCA1 mRNA expression (z-scores)

## What to Look For:

The scatter plot will show you the correlation between these two variables. If BRCA1 promoter methylation is associated with decreased expression, you should see:
- **Negative correlation:** Higher methylation values (right side of plot) corresponding to lower mRNA expression values (bottom of plot)
- The plot will display correlation statistics (Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficient and p-value)

## Additional Analysis Options:

Once on the page, you can:
1. **View correlation statistics** displayed on the plot
2. **Color points** by other clinical attributes (e.g., tumor stage, survival status)
3. **Download the data** for further statistical analysis
4. **Switch to log scale** if needed for better visualization

This is for research purposes only and shows population-level associations in this dataset.
