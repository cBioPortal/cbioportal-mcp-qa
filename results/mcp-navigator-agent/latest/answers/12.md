# Question 12

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** What is the most common cancer type in the MSK-CHORD Study based on sample count?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most common cancer type in the MSK-CHORD Study. Let me first locate this study and then navigate to its overview page where we can see the cancer type distribution.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Now let me navigate to the study view page where you can see the cancer type distribution:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Perfect! Here is the direct link to the MSK-CHORD Study overview:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024**

This study contains **25,040 samples** from multiple cancer types. When you open this link, you'll see the StudyView page with various charts including a "Cancer Type" chart that shows the distribution of samples across different cancer types, ranked by sample count.

The cancer type distribution chart on the Summary tab will show you which cancer type has the most samples. Common cancer types in MSK-CHORD typically include:
- Breast Cancer
- Prostate Cancer
- Lung Cancer
- Colorectal Cancer

The exact ranking by sample count will be visible in the "Cancer Type" or "Cancer Type Detailed" chart on the study page. You can click on any cancer type in the chart to filter the cohort to that specific type.
