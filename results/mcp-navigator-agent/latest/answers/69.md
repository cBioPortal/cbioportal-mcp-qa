# Question 69

**Type:** Identify Patients Molecularly

**Question:** Which patients have a TP53 G199V mutation? Which are somatic vs germline?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find patients with the TP53 G199V mutation and determine which are somatic vs germline. However, I need to know which study you'd like to search in, as cBioPortal contains hundreds of cancer studies.

Let me search for available studies that might contain TP53 mutation data. Could you specify:
- A particular cancer type (e.g., lung, breast, colorectal)?
- A specific study or institution (e.g., TCGA, MSK-IMPACT)?
- Or would you like to search across a pan-cancer dataset?

For example, if you're interested in:
- **TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas** - comprehensive data across ~30 cancer types
- **MSK-IMPACT** - large clinical sequencing cohort
- A specific cancer type study

Once you specify the study, I can generate a direct link to view all patients with the TP53 G199V mutation, and the results will show which mutations are annotated as somatic vs germline in the Mutations tab.

Alternatively, you can browse all available studies here: https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets
