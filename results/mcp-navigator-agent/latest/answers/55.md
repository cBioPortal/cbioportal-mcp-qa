# Question 55

**Type:** Survival Analysis

**Question:** What is the median survival time in the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the median survival time in the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET. Let me first locate the correct study.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "TARGET",
    "neuroblastoma"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json

```


I found 2 TARGET Neuroblastoma studies. The most comprehensive one is the **Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)** study with 1,089 samples. Let me navigate to the study view where you can see the survival data:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "nbl_target_2018_pub"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=nbl_target_2018_pub","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=nbl_target_2018_pub","data":{"studyIds":["nbl_target_2018_pub"],"studies":[{"studyId":"nbl_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)","sampleCount":1089}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


**Here is the direct link to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018) study:**

https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=nbl_target_2018_pub

Once you open this link, you'll see the Study View page. To find the **median survival time**:

1. Scroll down to find the **"Overall Survival"** chart on the study summary page
2. The survival curve will display the median survival time directly on the plot
3. You can also hover over the survival curve to see detailed statistics

This study contains 1,089 samples and includes overall survival data (OS_STATUS and OS_MONTHS clinical attributes), so the survival information should be readily available in the visualization.

**Note:** If you'd also like to explore the newer **Neuroblastoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)** study with 533 samples, here's that link: https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=nbl_target_gdc
