# Question 18

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What are the most frequently administered systemic therapy regimens for lung cancer patients in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find information about systemic therapy regimens in the MSK-CHORD lung cancer study. Let me start by locating this study in cBioPortal.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD",
    "lung"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"No matching studies found","details":{"searchTerms":["MSK-CHORD","lung"]}}
```


Let me try a broader search for MSK-CHORD:



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "MSK-CHORD"
  ]
}
```



Result from `resolve_and_route`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Found 1 study. Use navigate_to_studyview with the provided study metadata.","data":{"recommendedTool":"navigate_to_studyview","needsStudySelection":false,"totalCount":1,"resolvedStudyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studiesWithMetadata":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040,"studyViewUrl":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","metadata":{"clinicalAttributeIds":["ADRENAL_GLANDS","BONE","CANCER_TYPE","CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED","CLINICAL_GROUP","CLINICAL_SUMMARY","CNS_BRAIN","CURRENT_AGE_DEID","DIAGNOSIS_DESCRIPTION","ETHNICITY","FRACTION_GENOME_ALTERED","GENDER","GENE_PANEL","GLEASON_FIRST_REPORTED","GLEASON_HIGHEST_REPORTED","GLEASON_SAMPLE_LEVEL","HER2","HISTORY_OF_PDL1","HR","ICD_O_HISTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION","INTRA_ABDOMINAL","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH_NODES","METASTATIC_SITE","MSI_COMMENT","MSI_SCORE","MSI_TYPE","MUTATION_COUNT","NUM_ICDO_DX","ONCOTREE_CODE","OS_MONTHS","OS_STATUS","OTHER","PATHOLOGICAL_GROUP","PDL1_POSITIVE","PLEURA","PRIMARY_SITE","PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK","RACE","REPRODUCTIVE_ORGANS","SAMPLE_CLASS","SAMPLE_COUNT","SAMPLE_COVERAGE","SAMPLE_TYPE","SMOKING_PREDICTIONS_3_CLASSES","SOMATIC_STATUS","STAGE_HIGHEST_RECORDED","TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","TUMOR_PURITY"],"molecularProfileIds":["msk_chord_2024_cna","msk_chord_2024_mutations","msk_chord_2024_structural_variants"]}}]}}
```


Great! I found the MSK-CHORD study. This is a pan-cancer study that includes lung cancer patients. Now let me navigate to the study view where you can explore treatment information:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "msk_chord_2024"
  ]
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024","data":{"studyIds":["msk_chord_2024"],"studies":[{"studyId":"msk_chord_2024","name":"MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)","sampleCount":25040}],"hasFilters":false,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Perfect! Here is the direct link to the **MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)** study:

**https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study?id=msk_chord_2024**

This study contains 25,040 samples across multiple cancer types, including lung cancer.

## To find systemic therapy regimens for lung cancer patients:

1. **Filter for lung cancer patients:** Once on the study page, use the "Cancer Type" or "Cancer Type Detailed" filter on the left panel to select lung cancer subtypes (e.g., Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Lung Adenocarcinoma, etc.)

2. **View treatment data:** Look for treatment-related charts or tables in the study view. The MSK-CHORD study is known for its comprehensive treatment annotations, so there should be visualizations showing:
   - Most common treatment regimens
   - Treatment frequencies
   - Treatment response data

3. **Clinical Data tab:** You can also navigate to the "Clinical Data" tab to see detailed treatment information in tabular format, which you can sort and filter by frequency.

**Note:** The MSK-CHORD study (published in Nature 2024) is specifically designed to analyze clinical and genomic data together, including detailed treatment regimens, so it should have rich treatment annotation data available in the portal.

If you'd like me to help you create a filtered view specifically for lung cancer patients in this study, please let me know!
