# Question 63

**Type:** Conditional correlation

**Question:** "In breast cancer, what is the correlation coefficient between EGFR expression levels and PIK3CA mutation status considering only patients who also have a homozygous deletion of PTEN?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you explore the correlation between EGFR expression and PIK3CA mutation status in breast cancer patients with PTEN homozygous deletions. Let me start by finding the appropriate breast cancer study.



Calling `resolve_and_route` with args:
```json
{
  "targetPage": "study",
  "studyKeywords": [
    "breast",
    "TCGA"
  ]
}
```

Let me try again with the routing tool:

I found 37 breast cancer studies in cBioPortal. For your analysis involving EGFR expression, PIK3CA mutations, and PTEN homozygous deletions, I recommend using the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas** study as it has comprehensive molecular data including expression, mutations, and copy number alterations.

However, I need to inform you that **cBioPortal's current interface doesn't directly calculate correlation coefficients between expression levels and mutation status** through the navigation tools I have access to. 

Here's what I can help you do:

## Option 1: Set up the filtered cohort for manual analysis

I can create a StudyView URL that filters for patients with PTEN homozygous deletions in the TCGA Breast Cancer PanCancer Atlas study. From there, you can:
1. Navigate to the Plots tab
2. Set up a plot with EGFR expression on one axis
3. Color points by PIK3CA mutation status
4. Visually assess the correlation (cBioPortal may display correlation statistics in the plot)

Let me set this up for you:



Calling `navigate_to_studyview_page` with args:
```json
{
  "studyIds": [
    "brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"
  ],
  "filterJson": {
    "geneFilters": [
      {
        "molecularProfileIds": [
          "brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_gistic"
        ],
        "geneQueries": [
          [
            {
              "hugoGeneSymbol": "PTEN",
              "alterations": [
                "HOMDEL"
              ]
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "tab": "plots"
}
```



Result from `navigate_to_studyview_page`:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Navigating to https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018#filterJson={\"geneFilters\":[{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"alterations\":[\"HOMDEL\"],\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"PTEN\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_gistic\"]}]}","url":"https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018#filterJson={\"geneFilters\":[{\"geneQueries\":[[{\"alterations\":[\"HOMDEL\"],\"hugoGeneSymbol\":\"PTEN\"}]],\"molecularProfileIds\":[\"brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_gistic\"]}]}","data":{"studyIds":["brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018"],"studies":[{"studyId":"brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","name":"Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","sampleCount":1084}],"tab":"plots","hasFilters":true,"hasPlotsConfig":false}}
```


Perfect! Here's your direct link to explore this analysis:

**🔗 [View PTEN homozygous deletion cohort in Breast Cancer (TCGA PanCancer Atlas) - Plots Tab](https://deploy-preview-5312--cbioportalfrontend.netlify.app/study/plots?id=brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018#filterJson={%22geneFilters%22:[{%22geneQueries%22:[[{%22alterations%22:[%22HOMDEL%22],%22hugoGeneSymbol%22:%22PTEN%22}]],%22molecularProfileIds%22:[%22brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_gistic%22]}]})**

## How to calculate the correlation:

Once you click the link above:

1. **Configure the X-axis:**
   - Select "Gene" data type
   - Choose EGFR
   - Select the mRNA expression profile (e.g., "mRNA Expression z-Scores")

2. **Configure the Y-axis:**
   - You can either:
     - **Option A:** Set Y-axis to another continuous variable and use the "Color by" feature to color points by PIK3CA mutation status
     - **Option B:** Create a categorical Y-axis based on PIK3CA mutation status

3. **View correlation statistics:**
   - cBioPortal's Plots tab typically displays Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients when plotting two continuous variables
   - For mutation status (categorical) vs expression (continuous), you may need to assess this visually or export the data

## Option 2: Download data for external analysis

For a precise correlation coefficient calculation, you may want to:
1. Use the link above to identify the PTEN-deleted cohort
2. Click the "Download" tab to export clinical and molecular data
3. Perform the correlation analysis in R, Python, or your preferred statistical software

This approach gives you full control over the statistical method (point-biserial correlation for continuous vs binary data).
