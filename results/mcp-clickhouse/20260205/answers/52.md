# Question 52

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?

**Answer:**

## Answer

The most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study (PanCancer Atlas) is **R175H**, a missense mutation found in **21 samples**.

### Top 5 Most Frequent TP53 Mutations:

1. **R175H** (Missense) - 21 samples
2. **R273H** (Missense) - 13 samples
3. **R196*** (Nonsense) - 8 samples
4. **R342*** (Nonsense) - 7 samples
5. **R213*** (Nonsense) - 7 samples

### Context:
- **Total TP53 mutations**: 353 mutations across 347 samples
- **Unique variants**: 198 different TP53 variants
- **Study**: Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)

The R175H mutation is a well-known hotspot mutation in TP53 that affects the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein. This missense mutation replaces arginine at position 175 with histidine, which is one of the most common TP53 mutations across multiple cancer types and is associated with loss of tumor suppressor function.
