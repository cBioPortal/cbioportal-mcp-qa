# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently altered genes in a structural variant in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study. Let me start by finding the correct study identifier.

# Osteosarcoma (TARGET, 2018)

**Study ID:** `os_target_gdc`

## Overview
Pediatric osteosarcoma study from the TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) initiative. Whole exome sequencing data.

## Gene Panel
- **WES** (Whole Exome Sequencing): All coding genes profiled
- For mutation frequency calculations, you can use study-wide sample counts as the denominator (all genes equally covered)

## Clinical Attributes - Semantic Guide

### Patient Demographics
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `AGE` | Age at diagnosis | In years; pediatric population |
| `SEX` | Patient sex | Male, Female |
| `RACE` | Patient race | Per NIH categories |
| `ETHNICITY` | Patient ethnicity | Hispanic/Latino status |

### Disease Characteristics
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `DISEASE` | Disease type | Should be "Osteosarcoma" |
| `TUMOR_SITE` | Primary tumor location | e.g., Femur, Tibia |
| `HISTOLOGY` | Histological subtype | Osteoblastic, Chondroblastic, etc. |

### Clinical Outcomes
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `OS_MONTHS` | Overall survival in months | Time from diagnosis |
| `OS_STATUS` | Overall survival status | 0:LIVING, 1:DECEASED |
| `EFS_MONTHS` | Event-free survival in months | Time to first event |
| `EFS_STATUS` | Event-free survival status | 0:No event, 1:Event |

### Treatment Response
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `PERCENT_NECROSIS` | Tumor necrosis percentage post-chemotherapy |
| `NECROSIS_GROUP` | Grouped necrosis response |

## Notes & Caveats
- This is a pediatric cancer cohort; age distribution is younger than adult studies
- WES coverage means no gene panel filtering needed for frequency calculations
- Part of TARGET consortium; integrated with other pediatric cancer data

Perfect! I can see there's a `structural_variant` table and also the `genomic_event_derived` table which includes structural variants. Let me check the structure and query for the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants for the os_target_gdc study.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as sample_count,\n    COUNT(*) as event_count\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND variant_type = 'structural_variant'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol != ''\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY sample_count DESC, event_count DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[]}
```


Let me check if there are any structural variants in this study at all:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT COUNT(*) as total_structural_variants\nFROM structural_variant sv\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON sv.genetic_profile_id = gp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_structural_variants":0}]}
```


Let me verify what types of genomic data are available in this study:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    gp.genetic_alteration_type,\n    gp.stable_id,\n    gp.name,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sp.sample_id) as sample_count\nFROM genetic_profile gp\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nLEFT JOIN sample_profile sp ON gp.genetic_profile_id = sp.genetic_profile_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\nGROUP BY gp.genetic_alteration_type, gp.stable_id, gp.name\nORDER BY gp.genetic_alteration_type\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"genetic_alteration_type":"COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_cna","gp.name":"Putative copy-number alterations from GISTIC","sample_count":81},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_rna_seq_mrna","gp.name":"mRNA Expression","sample_count":88},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm","gp.name":"mRNA Expression (TPM)","sample_count":88},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm_Zscores","gp.name":"mRNA Expression FPKM z-scores","sample_count":88},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_fpkm","gp.name":"mRNA Expression (FPKM)","sample_count":88},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_tpm_Zscores","gp.name":"mRNA Expression TPM z-scores","sample_count":88},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MRNA_EXPRESSION","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mrna_seq_read_counts_Zscores","gp.name":"mRNA Expression z-scores","sample_count":88},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MUTATION_EXTENDED","stable_id":"os_target_gdc_mutations","gp.name":"Mutations","sample_count":143}]}
```


Based on my analysis, **the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc) does not contain structural variant data**. 

The study includes:
- **Mutation data** (143 samples)
- **Copy number alteration data** (81 samples)  
- **mRNA expression data** (88 samples)

But there are **0 structural variants** recorded in this dataset.

This is not uncommon for older or certain types of genomic studies, as structural variant detection requires specific sequencing approaches (like whole genome sequencing or RNA-seq fusion detection) and analysis pipelines that may not have been part of the original TARGET osteosarcoma project.

If you're interested in the most frequently altered genes in this study through **other types of alterations** (mutations or copy number changes), I'd be happy to provide that information instead!
