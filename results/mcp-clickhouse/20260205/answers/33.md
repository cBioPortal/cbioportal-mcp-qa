# Question 33

**Type:** Copy Number Expression Correlation

**Question:** What is the correlation coefficient between EGFR copy number and EGFR mRNA expression in ovarian cancer?

**Answer:**

## Summary

Based on the analysis of ovarian cancer data in cBioPortal, here are the **correlation coefficients between EGFR copy number and EGFR mRNA expression**:

### Results by Study:

1. **TCGA PanCancer Atlas (ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018)**
   - **Correlation coefficient: 0.31** (moderate positive correlation)
   - Sample count: 295 samples
   - Average CNA: 0.17 (mostly diploid)
   - Average mRNA: 280.2

2. **TCGA Firehose Legacy (ov_tcga)**
   - **Correlation coefficient: 0.30** (moderate positive correlation)
   - Sample count: 300 samples
   - Average CNA: 0.18
   - Average mRNA: 505.0

3. **TCGA GDC (hgsoc_tcga_gdc)**
   - **Correlation coefficient: 0.10** (weak positive correlation)
   - Sample count: 410 samples
   - Average CNA: 0.58
   - Average mRNA: 2763.3

### Interpretation:

The correlation between EGFR copy number and mRNA expression in ovarian cancer is **positive but modest**, ranging from **0.10 to 0.31** depending on the dataset. The two TCGA legacy datasets show more consistent moderate correlations (~0.30), suggesting that EGFR copy number alterations do influence mRNA expression levels, but other regulatory factors (transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modifications, etc.) also play significant roles in determining EGFR expression levels in ovarian cancer.
