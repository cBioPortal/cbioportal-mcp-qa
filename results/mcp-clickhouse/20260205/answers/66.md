# Question 66

**Type:** Cross-Cohort Comparison

**Question:** In colorectal cancer do patients with microsatellite instability in the TCGA dataset have a similar prognosis as those in the MSK Gastroenterology 2020 study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have all the data needed to provide a comprehensive comparison. Let me summarize the findings:

## Prognosis Comparison: MSI Colorectal Cancer Patients

Based on the cBioPortal data, I can compare the prognosis of microsatellite instability (MSI) patients between the TCGA PanCancer Atlas and MSK Gastroenterology 2020 studies:

### Key Findings:

**TCGA PanCancer Atlas (2018) - MSI-H Patients:**
- **N = 67 patients** with MSI-H (MANTIS score > 0.6)
- **Median OS: 21.4 months**
- **Mean OS: 28.0 months**
- **Mortality: 20.9%** (14 deceased, 53 living)
- Range: 0-135.6 months

**MSK Gastroenterology 2020 - MSI (Instable) Patients:**
- **N = 27 patients** with MSI (Instable)
- **Median OS: 21.6 months**
- **Mean OS: 23.3 months**
- **Mortality: 55.6%** (15 deceased, 12 living)
- Range: 2.2-70.9 months

### Important Differences:

**The prognosis appears WORSE in the MSK study despite similar median survival:**

1. **Mortality Rate:** MSK patients had much higher mortality (55.6% vs 20.9%), suggesting more aggressive disease or shorter follow-up

2. **Patient Population:** The MSK study specifically enrolled **"unresectable colorectal tumor"** patients - these are advanced, metastatic cases. The TCGA dataset includes a broader range of disease stages.

3. **Survival Distribution:** While median OS is similar (~21 months), the MSK cohort has:
   - Higher minimum survival (2.2 vs 0 months)
   - Lower maximum survival (70.9 vs 135.6 months)
   - More concentrated around the median

### Context - MSI vs MSS Comparison:

Interestingly, within each study:
- **TCGA:** MSI-H and MSS patients had similar survival (median ~21 months both)
- **MSK:** MSI patients actually had slightly better survival than MSS (median 21.6 vs 19.0 months, mortality 55.6% vs 65.9%)

### Conclusion:

The **median overall survival is remarkably similar** (~21 months) between the two studies for MSI patients. However, the **MSK cohort has significantly worse outcomes overall** due to the study design focusing on unresectable/advanced disease, resulting in much higher mortality rates. The TCGA data represents a more general colorectal cancer population with better long-term survival potential.
