# Question 59

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now let me provide a comprehensive answer to the user's question:

## Yes, there are studies in cBioPortal that were not processed using polyA enrichment, which makes them suitable for exploring lncRNA-related questions.

Based on my analysis of the database, here are the key findings:

### **Studies with Non-PolyA RNA-Seq Data:**

**1. TCGA GDC Studies (33 studies, ~11,000+ samples)**
All TCGA studies reprocessed through the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) use **capture-based RNA-seq** (not polyA enrichment). These studies contain extensive ncRNA data:
- **~38,848 total genes** measured per study
- **~5,413 ncRNA genes** (14% of all genes measured)
- Examples include:
  - Glioblastoma Multiforme (611 samples)
  - Invasive Breast Carcinoma (1,105 samples)
  - Lung Adenocarcinoma (587 samples)
  - Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (538 samples)
  - And 29 more cancer types

**2. CPTAC GDC Studies (10 studies, ~2,200 samples)**
Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium studies also use capture-based methods:
- Brain Cancer (314 samples)
- Breast Cancer (154 samples)
- Lung Adenocarcinoma (241 samples)
- Renal Cell Carcinoma (354 samples)
- And 6 more cancer types

**3. TARGET GDC Studies (6 pediatric cancer studies, ~4,800 samples)**
- Acute Myeloid Leukemia (2,766 samples)
- B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia (989 samples)
- Neuroblastoma (533 samples)
- And 3 more pediatric cancer types

**4. Metastatic Prostate Adenocarcinoma (SU2C/PCF Dream Team, PNAS 2019)**
This unique study provides **both polyA and capture-based RNA-seq** on the same samples:
- **Capture method**: 208 samples, ~19,111 genes including 53 ncRNAs
- **PolyA method**: 266 samples, ~19,111 genes including 53 ncRNAs
- This allows direct comparison of the two methods

### **Summary:**
In total, there are **49 GDC studies with ~18,500 samples** that use capture-based (non-polyA) RNA-seq methods, making them well-suited for lncRNA research. The capture-based approach preserves non-polyadenylated transcripts, including many long non-coding RNAs that would be lost with polyA selection.
