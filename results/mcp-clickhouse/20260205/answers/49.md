# Question 49

**Type:** Aneuploidy Analysis

**Question:** Which cancer types have the highest aneuploidy scores and how does this correlate with mutation burden across TCGA Pan-Cancer studies?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have all the data needed to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me compile the findings:

## Analysis: Aneuploidy Scores and Mutation Burden Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Studies

Based on the analysis of 32 TCGA PanCancer Atlas studies, here are the key findings:

### **Cancer Types with Highest Aneuploidy Scores:**

**Top 10 Cancer Types by Mean Aneuploidy Score:**

1. **Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TGCT)** - 18.83 (median: 19.0, n=149)
2. **Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC)** - 18.29 (median: 17.0, n=89)
3. **Uterine Carcinosarcoma (UCS)** - 17.21 (median: 19.0, n=56)
4. **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)** - 16.21 (median: 16.0, n=479)
5. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** - 15.04 (median: 16.0, n=501)
6. **Kidney Chromophobe (KICH)** - 14.86 (median: 14.0, n=65)
7. **Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (ESCA)** - 14.57 (median: 14.5, n=162)
8. **Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (OV)** - 14.00 (median: 13.0, n=504)
9. **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA)** - 13.58 (median: 14.0, n=400)
10. **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM)** - 13.01 (median: 11.0, n=431)

**Lowest Aneuploidy Scores:**
- **Thyroid Carcinoma (THCA)** - 0.86 (median: 0.0, n=460)
- **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (LAML)** - 1.56 (median: 0.0, n=124)
- **Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD)** - 2.53 (median: 1.0, n=471)

### **Correlation Between Aneuploidy and Mutation Burden:**

The relationship between aneuploidy scores and tumor mutation burden (TMB) varies significantly across cancer types:

#### **Positive Correlations (≥0.2):** 4 studies
These cancer types show higher aneuploidy associated with higher mutation burden:

1. **Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBC)** - r=0.344 (strongest positive)
   - Mean aneuploidy: 6.78, Mean TMB: 3.96
2. **Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma (PCPG)** - r=0.227
   - Mean aneuploidy: 5.56, Mean TMB: 0.34
3. **Kidney Chromophobe (KICH)** - r=0.205
   - Mean aneuploidy: 14.86, Mean TMB: 1.09
4. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** - r=0.203
   - Mean aneuploidy: 15.04, Mean TMB: 10.24

#### **Negative Correlations (≤-0.2):** 4 studies
These cancer types show higher aneuploidy associated with *lower* mutation burden:

1. **Uterine Carcinosarcoma (UCS)** - r=-0.393 (strongest negative)
   - Mean aneuploidy: 17.21, Mean TMB: 4.32
2. **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD)** - r=-0.357
   - Mean aneuploidy: 12.32, Mean TMB: 13.02
3. **Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD)** - r=-0.280
   - Mean aneuploidy: 11.17, Mean TMB: 12.87
4. **Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)** - r=-0.229
   - Mean aneuploidy: 6.07, Mean TMB: 35.62 (highest TMB!)

#### **Weak/No Correlation (-0.2 to 0.2):** 24 studies
The majority of cancer types show little to no correlation between aneuploidy and mutation burden.

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Aneuploidy and TMB are largely independent:** 75% of cancer types (24/32) show weak or no correlation, suggesting these are distinct mechanisms of genomic instability.

2. **Inverse relationship in some cancers:** Notably, colorectal, stomach, and endometrial cancers show negative correlations, suggesting that hypermutated tumors (often due to mismatch repair deficiency) may have lower chromosomal instability.

3. **Endometrial cancer paradox:** UCEC has the highest mean TMB (35.62) but one of the lowest aneuploidy scores (6.07), reflecting the high prevalence of microsatellite instability in this cancer type.

4. **Lung cancers show positive correlation:** Both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma show modest positive correlations, suggesting coordinated genomic instability.

5. **Testicular and adrenocortical cancers:** These have the highest aneuploidy but relatively low TMB, indicating chromosomal instability as the primary driver of genomic alterations.

This analysis demonstrates that aneuploidy and mutation burden represent distinct and often independent pathways of genomic instability across different cancer types.
