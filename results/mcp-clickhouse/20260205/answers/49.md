# Question 49

**Type:** Aneuploidy Analysis

**Question:** Which cancer types have the highest aneuploidy scores and how does this correlate with mutation burden across TCGA Pan-Cancer studies?

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze aneuploidy scores and their correlation with mutation burden across TCGA Pan-Cancer studies. Let me start by exploring the available data.

Great! I can see there are TCGA PanCancer Atlas studies. Let me check what clinical attributes are available, particularly looking for aneuploidy scores and mutation burden metrics.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT cancer_study_identifier\nFROM cancer_study\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018%'\nORDER BY cancer_study_identifier\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

```


Perfect! Now let me check what clinical attributes are available across these PanCancer Atlas studies, specifically looking for aneuploidy scores and mutation burden:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT attr_id, description\nFROM clinical_attribute_meta cam\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON cam.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018%'\n  AND (attr_id LIKE '%aneu%' OR attr_id LIKE '%ploidy%' OR description LIKE '%aneu%' OR description LIKE '%ploidy%')\nORDER BY attr_id\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"attr_id":"ANEUPLOIDY_SCORE","description":"Aneuploidy Score"}]}
```




Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json

  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT attr_id, description\nFROM clinical_attribute_meta cam\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON cam.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018%'\n  AND (attr_id LIKE '%MUTATION%' OR attr_id LIKE '%TMB%' OR description LIKE '%mutation%' OR description LIKE '%burden%')\nORDER BY attr_id\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"attr_id":"MUTATION_COUNT","description":"Mutation Count"},{"attr_id":"TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS","description":"TMB (nonsynonymous)"}]}
```


Excellent! Now let me query the data to find which cancer types have the highest aneuploidy scores and analyze the correlation with mutation burden:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json

  "query": "\nWITH aneuploidy_data AS (\n  SELECT \n    cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n    cs.name as study_name,\n    cd1.sample_unique_id,\n    cd1.attribute_value as aneuploidy_score,\n    cd2.attribute_value as mutation_count,\n    cd3.attribute_value as tmb,\n    cd4.attribute_value as cancer_type\n  FROM clinical_data_derived cd1\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON cd1.cancer_study_identifier = cs.cancer_study_identifier\n  LEFT JOIN clinical_data_derived cd2 \n    ON cd1.sample_unique_id = cd2.sample_unique_id \n    AND cd2.attribute_name = 'MUTATION_COUNT'\n  LEFT JOIN clinical_data_derived cd3 \n    ON cd1.sample_unique_id = cd3.sample_unique_id \n    AND cd3.attribute_name = 'TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS'\n  LEFT JOIN clinical_data_derived cd4 \n    ON cd1.sample_unique_id = cd4.sample_unique_id \n    AND cd4.attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n  WHERE cd1.attribute_name = 'ANEUPLOIDY_SCORE'\n    AND cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018%'\n    AND cd1.attribute_value != 'NA'\n    AND cd1.attribute_value != ''\n)\nSELECT \n  cancer_type,\n  COUNT(*) as sample_count,\n  ROUND(AVG(toFloat64OrNull(aneuploidy_score)), 3) as avg_aneuploidy_score,\n  ROUND(AVG(toFloat64OrNull(mutation_count)), 2) as avg_mutation_count,\n  ROUND(AVG(toFloat64OrNull(tmb)), 3) as avg_tmb,\n  ROUND(MIN(toFloat64OrNull(aneuploidy_score)), 3) as min_aneuploidy,\n  ROUND(MAX(toFloat64OrNull(aneuploidy_score)), 3) as max_aneuploidy\nFROM aneuploidy_data\nWHERE cancer_type IS NOT NULL AND cancer_type != 'NA' AND cancer_type != ''\nGROUP BY cancer_type\nHAVING sample_count >= 10\nORDER BY avg_aneuploidy_score DESC\nLIMIT 30\n"

Now let me calculate the overall correlation across all cancer types:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH aneuploidy_data AS (\n  SELECT \n    toFloat64OrNull(cd1.attribute_value) as aneuploidy_score,\n    toFloat64OrNull(cd2.attribute_value) as mutation_count,\n    toFloat64OrNull(cd3.attribute_value) as tmb\n  FROM clinical_data_derived cd1\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON cd1.cancer_study_identifier = cs.cancer_study_identifier\n  LEFT JOIN clinical_data_derived cd2 \n    ON cd1.sample_unique_id = cd2.sample_unique_id \n    AND cd2.attribute_name = 'MUTATION_COUNT'\n  LEFT JOIN clinical_data_derived cd3 \n    ON cd1.sample_unique_id = cd3.sample_unique_id \n    AND cd3.attribute_name = 'TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS'\n  WHERE cd1.attribute_name = 'ANEUPLOIDY_SCORE'\n    AND cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018%'\n    AND cd1.attribute_value != 'NA'\n    AND cd1.attribute_value != ''\n    AND cd2.attribute_value IS NOT NULL\n    AND cd3.attribute_value IS NOT NULL\n)\nSELECT \n  COUNT(*) as total_samples,\n  ROUND(corr(aneuploidy_score, mutation_count), 4) as overall_corr_mutation_count,\n  ROUND(corr(aneuploidy_score, tmb), 4) as overall_corr_tmb,\n  ROUND(AVG(aneuploidy_score), 2) as avg_aneuploidy,\n  ROUND(AVG(mutation_count), 2) as avg_mutation_count,\n  ROUND(AVG(tmb), 2) as avg_tmb,\n  ROUND(stddevPop(aneuploidy_score), 2) as stddev_aneuploidy,\n  ROUND(stddevPop(mutation_count), 2) as stddev_mutation_count\nFROM aneuploidy_data\nWHERE aneuploidy_score IS NOT NULL \n  AND mutation_count IS NOT NULL \n  AND tmb IS NOT NULL\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_samples":9678,"overall_corr_mutation_count":-0.0457,"overall_corr_tmb":-0.0447,"avg_aneuploidy":10.01,"avg_mutation_count":213.14,"avg_tmb":7.42,"stddev_aneuploidy":8.28,"stddev_mutation_count":802.6}]}
```


Let me also get some additional statistics about the distribution:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n  COUNT(DISTINCT cs.cancer_study_identifier) as num_studies,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT cd4.attribute_value) as num_cancer_types,\n  COUNT(*) as total_samples_with_aneuploidy\nFROM clinical_data_derived cd1\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON cd1.cancer_study_identifier = cs.cancer_study_identifier\nLEFT JOIN clinical_data_derived cd4 \n  ON cd1.sample_unique_id = cd4.sample_unique_id \n  AND cd4.attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\nWHERE cd1.attribute_name = 'ANEUPLOIDY_SCORE'\n  AND cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018%'\n  AND cd1.attribute_value != 'NA'\n  AND cd1.attribute_value != ''\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"num_studies":32,"num_cancer_types":30,"total_samples_with_aneuploidy":10440}]}
```


Perfect! Now let me create a visualization-friendly summary of cancer types with extreme correlations:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:

Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me create a summary of the findings:

## Analysis of Aneuploidy Scores and Mutation Burden Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Studies

### Overview
I analyzed **10,440 samples** across **32 TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018 studies** representing **30 different cancer types**.

---

### **Cancer Types with Highest Aneuploidy Scores**

| Rank | Cancer Type | Avg Aneuploidy Score | Sample Count | Avg TMB | Avg Mutation Count |
|------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Seminoma** | 19.11 | 63 | 0.44 | 14.0 |
| 2 | **Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Tumor** | 18.62 | 86 | 0.52 | 15.9 |
| 3 | **Adrenocortical Carcinoma** | 18.29 | 89 | 2.83 | 84.5 |
| 4 | **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** | 15.57 | 983 | 9.89 | 277.5 |
| 5 | **Ovarian Epithelial Tumor** | 13.98 | 552 | 2.26 | 86.4 |
| 6 | **Bladder Cancer** | 13.55 | 401 | 8.57 | 246.8 |
| 7 | **Melanoma** | 12.99 | 434 | 23.85 | 714.4 |
| 8 | **Colorectal Cancer** | 12.30 | 586 | 13.03 | 376.6 |
| 9 | **Breast Cancer** | 12.12 | 1,041 | 2.76 | 84.0 |
| 10 | **Esophagogastric Cancer** | 12.11 | 589 | 10.71 | 289.2 |

### **Cancer Types with Lowest Aneuploidy Scores**

| Cancer Type | Avg Aneuploidy Score | Sample Count | Avg TMB |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Thyroid Cancer** | 0.88 | 464 | 0.54 |
| **Leukemia** | 1.57 | 124 | 1.67 |
| **Prostate Cancer** | 2.53 | 471 | 1.61 |
| **Glioma** | 3.84 | 507 | 1.79 |

---

### **Correlation Between Aneuploidy and Mutation Burden**

#### Overall Pan-Cancer Correlation:
- **Correlation coefficient: -0.045** (very weak negative correlation)
- This suggests that **across all cancer types, aneuploidy and mutation burden are largely independent**

#### Cancer Types with Strongest NEGATIVE Correlations:
(Higher aneuploidy → Lower mutation burden)

| Cancer Type | Correlation | Sample Count | Avg Aneuploidy | Avg TMB |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Colorectal Cancer** | -0.357 | 523 | 12.24 | 13.17 |
| **Esophagogastric Cancer** | -0.277 | 585 | 12.11 | 10.71 |
| **Endometrial Cancer** | -0.248 | 560 | 7.11 | 32.62 |
| **Cervical Cancer** | -0.120 | 278 | 10.36 | 6.65 |

#### Cancer Types with Strongest POSITIVE Correlations:
(Higher aneuploidy → Higher mutation burden)

| Cancer Type | Correlation | Sample Count | Avg Aneuploidy | Avg TMB |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Pheochromocytoma** | 0.251 | 133 | 5.86 | 0.34
