# Question 26

**Type:** Gene Panels

**Question:** What percentage of genomic events in the MSK-CHORD Study occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used)?

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a clear answer:

## MSK-CHORD Study: Off-Panel Genomic Events

In the **MSK-CHORD Study (msk_chord_2024)**, **1.02%** of genomic events occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used).

### Detailed Breakdown:

**Overall Statistics:**
- **Total genomic events:** 279,212
- **Off-panel events:** 2,849 (1.02%)
- **On-panel events:** 276,363 (98.98%)

**By Variant Type:**

1. **Mutations:**
   - Total: 208,214 events
   - Off-panel: 150 (0.07%)
   - On-panel: 208,064 (99.93%)

2. **Copy Number Alterations (CNA):**
   - Total: 60,787 events
   - Off-panel: 0 (0.0%)
   - On-panel: 60,787 (100%)

3. **Structural Variants:**
   - Total: 10,211 events
   - Off-panel: 2,699 (26.43%)
   - On-panel: 7,512 (73.57%)

### Key Findings:

The vast majority of genomic events (98.98%) are detected in genes covered by the sequencing panel. However, there's a notable difference by variant type:
- **Structural variants** have the highest off-panel rate at 26.43%, likely because these events can involve genes outside the targeted panel
- **Mutations** are almost entirely on-panel (99.93%), as expected for targeted sequencing
- **CNAs** are 100% on-panel in this study
