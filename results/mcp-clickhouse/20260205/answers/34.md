# Question 34

**Type:** Protein Expression Correlation

**Question:** What is the correlation between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels in ovarian cancer samples?

**Answer:**

## Summary: Correlation between EGFR mRNA Expression and EGFR Protein Levels in Ovarian Cancer

Based on analysis of TCGA ovarian cancer data in cBioPortal, I found a **moderate positive correlation** between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels:

### Key Findings:

**Study 1: Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, Firehose Legacy)**
- **Sample size:** 241 samples with both mRNA (RNA-seq) and protein (RPPA) data
- **Pearson correlation (r):** 0.52
- **R-squared:** 0.27 (27% of variance explained)
- **Mean mRNA expression:** 516.9 (SD: 475.2)
- **Mean protein level:** 0.04 (SD: 0.26)

**Study 2: Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)**
- **Sample size:** 236 samples with both mRNA and protein data
- **Pearson correlation (r):** 0.51
- **R-squared:** 0.26 (26% of variance explained)
- **Mean mRNA expression:** 289.2 (SD: 265.6)
- **Mean protein level:** -0.22 (SD: 0.22)

### Interpretation:

The correlation of **r ≈ 0.51-0.52** indicates a **moderate positive relationship** between EGFR mRNA expression and protein levels in ovarian cancer samples. This means:

1. **Consistent finding:** Both independent TCGA datasets show nearly identical correlations, validating the result
2. **Moderate correlation:** While there is a clear positive relationship, mRNA levels explain only about 26-27% of the variation in protein levels
3. **Post-transcriptional regulation:** The remaining ~73% of variance suggests significant post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation of EGFR protein levels

This moderate correlation is typical for many genes, as protein levels are influenced by multiple factors beyond mRNA abundance, including translation efficiency, protein stability, and degradation rates.
