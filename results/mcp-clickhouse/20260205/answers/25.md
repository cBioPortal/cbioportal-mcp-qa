# Question 25

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Comparison

**Question:** How does the mutation landscape differ between primary and metastatic samples from the same patients in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data to answer the question. Let me compile the findings:

## Mutation Landscape Differences Between Primary and Metastatic Samples in MSK-CHORD Study

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD study (MSK, Nature 2024), I identified **26 patients** who had both primary and metastatic samples sequenced, allowing for direct paired comparison. Here are the key findings:

### 1. **Overall Mutation Burden**
- **Primary samples**: Average of 13.7 mutated genes per sample (range: 1-97, median: 6)
- **Metastatic samples**: Average of 9.9 mutated genes per sample (range: 1-47, median: 6)
- Despite similar medians, primary samples showed higher variability and more cases with very high mutation counts

### 2. **Mutation Overlap is Surprisingly Low**
- **Average shared mutations**: Only 1.1 genes shared between paired samples
- **Median shared mutations**: 0 genes (54% of patients had NO shared mutations)
- **Average concordance**: Only 5.5% of mutations were shared between primary and metastatic samples from the same patient
- Only 1 patient (P-0046090) showed high concordance with 66.7% shared mutations

### 3. **Most Frequently Mutated Genes Overall**
The top mutated genes across both sample types:
- **TP53**: 50% of primary, 57.7% of metastatic samples (most frequently shared - 6 patients)
- **KRAS**: 38.5% of primary, 30.8% of metastatic samples (shared in 3 patients)
- **APC**: 26.9% of primary, 19.2% of metastatic samples (shared in 2 patients)

### 4. **Genes Enriched in Metastatic Samples**
Several genes showed preferential mutation in metastases:
- **MAP3K1** and **STK11**: 15.4% metastatic vs 3.8% primary (+11.5% difference)
- **MGA**: 11.5% metastatic vs 0% primary
- **KEAP1, CDKN2A, ARID1B**: 11.5% metastatic vs 3.8% primary
- **ATR**: 19.2% metastatic vs 11.5% primary

### 5. **Genes Enriched in Primary Samples**
Several genes were more commonly mutated in primary tumors:
- **RNF43**: 19.2% primary vs 3.8% metastatic (+15.4% difference)
- **MED12, AR, ERBB2, FANCA**: 11.5% primary vs 0% metastatic
- **POLE, BRAF**: 15.4% primary vs 3.8% metastatic
- **KRAS**: 38.5% primary vs 30.8% metastatic

### 6. **Cancer Type Distribution**
The paired samples came from diverse cancer types:
- Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: 18 patients
- Colorectal Cancer: 12 patients
- Pancreatic Cancer: 9 patients
- Prostate Cancer: 7 patients
- Breast Cancer: 6 patients

### Key Insights:

1. **High Genetic Divergence**: The extremely low mutation overlap suggests substantial genetic evolution between primary tumors and their metastases, indicating that metastases may acquire many new mutations or arise from minor subclones.

2. **Metastatic-Specific Alterations**: Genes like STK11, KEAP1, and MAP3K1 (involved in stress response and metabolism) appear enriched in metastases, potentially reflecting adaptation to metastatic microenvironments.

3. **Primary-Specific Alterations**: Genes like RNF43 (Wnt signaling), POLE (DNA repair), and BRAF (MAPK pathway) were more common in primary tumors, suggesting these may be early driver events.

4. **TP53 Dominance**: TP53 was the most consistently mutated gene across both sample types and the most frequently shared mutation, confirming its role as a key driver in cancer progression.

This analysis reveals that primary and metastatic tumors from the same patient can be remarkably genetically distinct, with implications for treatment strategies and understanding metastatic evolution.
