# Question 22

**Type:** Survival Analysis

**Question:** Do patients with PIK3CA mutations have different overall survival outcomes compared to PIK3CA wild-type patients in breast cancer from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a complete analysis:

## Overall Survival Analysis: PIK3CA Mutations in Breast Cancer (MSK-CHORD Study)

Based on the MSK-CHORD study data, here's a comprehensive comparison of overall survival outcomes between PIK3CA mutant and wild-type breast cancer patients:

### **Summary Statistics**

| Group | Patients | Mean OS (months) | Median OS (months) | Deceased | Living | Mortality Rate |
|-------|----------|------------------|-------------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **PIK3CA Mutant** | 1,908 | 40.87 | 37.79 | 718 | 1,190 | 37.6% |
| **PIK3CA Wild-type** | 3,460 | 39.68 | 35.47 | 1,272 | 2,188 | 36.8% |

### **Key Findings**

1. **Similar Overall Survival**: PIK3CA mutant patients show slightly **better** survival outcomes compared to wild-type patients:
   - **Median OS**: 37.79 months (mutant) vs 35.47 months (wild-type) - a difference of ~2.3 months
   - **Mean OS**: 40.87 months (mutant) vs 39.68 months (wild-type) - a difference of ~1.2 months

2. **Mortality Rates**: Nearly identical mortality rates between groups:
   - PIK3CA Mutant: 37.6%
   - PIK3CA Wild-type: 36.8%

3. **Survival Distribution** (interquartile range):
   - **PIK3CA Mutant**: 25th percentile = 16.5 months, 75th percentile = 64.3 months
   - **PIK3CA Wild-type**: 25th percentile = 15.6 months, 75th percentile = 62.3 months

4. **PIK3CA Mutation Prevalence**: 
   - 1,908 of 5,368 breast cancer patients (35.5%) harbor PIK3CA mutations

### **Most Common PIK3CA Mutations in Breast Cancer**

| Mutation | Type | Patients |
|----------|------|----------|
| H1047R | Missense | 709 |
| E545K | Missense | 414 |
| E542K | Missense | 218 |
| N345K | Missense | 122 |
| H1047L | Missense | 89 |

### **Clinical Interpretation**

The data suggests that **PIK3CA mutation status alone does not significantly impact overall survival** in this breast cancer cohort from MSK-CHORD. The differences observed are minimal (2-3 months in median OS), and mortality rates are nearly identical.

**Important Considerations:**
- This is observational data from a single study
- Survival outcomes may be influenced by treatment regimens (including PI3K inhibitors)
- Breast cancer is heterogeneous; PIK3CA mutations may have different prognostic implications in specific subtypes (ER+, HER2+, triple-negative)
- The study includes patients who received various treatments over time, which may confound the relationship between mutation status and survival

For definitive conclusions about the prognostic or predictive value of PIK3CA mutations, controlled clinical trials and subgroup analyses by breast cancer subtype would be needed.
