# Question 29

**Type:** Basic Query - Mutual Exclusivity

**Question:** "Are mutations in CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1 mutually exclusive in glioblastoma patients?"

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have all the data I need to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me compile the findings:

## Answer: Mutations in CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1 are **NOT strictly mutually exclusive** in glioblastoma patients

Based on analysis of the **Merged Cohort of LGG and GBM (TCGA, Cell 2016)** study with 1,094 samples, here are the key findings:

### Overall Alteration Frequencies:
- **CDKN2A**: 386 samples (35.3%) - primarily deletions (CNA)
- **CDK4**: 102 samples (9.3%) - primarily amplifications (CNA)
- **RB1**: 48 samples (4.4%) - both mutations and deletions

### Co-occurrence Patterns:

**28 samples (2.6% of total, 5.5% of altered samples) showed co-occurring alterations:**

1. **CDKN2A + CDK4**: 16 samples (most common co-occurrence)
2. **CDKN2A + RB1**: 11 samples
3. **CDK4 + RB1**: 1 sample
4. **All three genes**: 0 samples

### Key Observations:

1. **Predominantly mutually exclusive**: The vast majority of samples (480/508 = 94.5%) with alterations in these genes have alterations in only ONE of the three genes, suggesting a strong tendency toward mutual exclusivity.

2. **CDKN2A + CDK4 co-occurrence**: The most frequent co-occurrence (16 samples) involves CDKN2A deletion with CDK4 amplification. This makes biological sense as both alterations drive cell cycle progression through the same pathway but via different mechanisms.

3. **CDKN2A + RB1 co-occurrence**: 11 samples show both CDKN2A and RB1 alterations, suggesting that in some cases, multiple hits to the RB pathway occur.

4. **Rare CDK4 + RB1 co-occurrence**: Only 1 sample shows both CDK4 and RB1 alterations.

5. **No triple alterations**: No samples have alterations in all three genes simultaneously.

### Biological Interpretation:

These genes all function in the **RB tumor suppressor pathway**:
- CDKN2A (p16) inhibits CDK4/6
- CDK4 phosphorylates RB1
- RB1 controls cell cycle progression

The data suggests that while these alterations are **largely mutually exclusive** (consistent with the "one-hit" model where a single pathway disruption is sufficient), there are notable exceptions where multiple alterations co-occur, particularly CDKN2A loss with CDK4 amplification, which may provide additional selective advantage in tumor progression.
