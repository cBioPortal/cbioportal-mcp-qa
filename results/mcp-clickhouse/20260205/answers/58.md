# Question 58

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Gene Alteration

**Question:** In the “Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes” study what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes study (ICGC/TCGA, Nature 2020), here are the findings regarding survival differences between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only KRAS mutations:

## Summary of Findings

### Patient Cohorts:
- **Both TP53 + KRAS mutations**: 187 patients
- **KRAS only mutations**: 85 patients
- **Total**: 272 patients with survival status data

### Mortality Rates:
- **Both TP53 + KRAS**: 122 deceased / 65 living = **65.24% mortality rate**
- **KRAS only**: 41 deceased / 44 living = **48.24% mortality rate**
- **Difference**: **17.0 percentage points higher mortality** in the double-mutant group

### Statistical Significance:
Using a Chi-square test for the 2×2 contingency table:
- **Chi-square statistic**: 7.037 (df = 1)
- **P-value**: ~0.008 (statistically significant at p < 0.01)

This indicates that patients with both TP53 and KRAS mutations have **significantly worse survival** compared to patients with only KRAS mutations.

### Important Limitations:
1. **Limited survival time data**: Only 4 patients (1 with both mutations, 3 with KRAS only) had actual survival time (OS_MONTHS) recorded, which is insufficient for Kaplan-Meier or hazard ratio analysis.
2. **Binary outcome only**: The analysis is based on survival status (deceased vs. living) rather than time-to-event data.
3. **Pan-cancer cohort**: This study includes 38 different tumor types, so the effect may vary by cancer type.

The data strongly suggests that co-occurrence of TP53 and KRAS mutations is associated with significantly poorer survival outcomes compared to KRAS mutations alone in this pan-cancer whole genome sequencing cohort.
