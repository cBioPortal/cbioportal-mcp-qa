# Question 63

**Type:** Conditional correlation

**Question:** "In breast cancer, what is the correlation coefficient between EGFR expression levels and PIK3CA mutation status considering only patients who also have a homozygous deletion of PTEN?"

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now let me provide a comprehensive answer to the user:

## Analysis Results

I analyzed breast cancer patients with homozygous PTEN deletions (cna_alteration = -2) across all breast cancer studies in cBioPortal to determine the correlation between EGFR expression levels and PIK3CA mutation status.

### Key Finding: **Correlation Cannot Be Calculated**

**The correlation coefficient cannot be calculated because there is no variation in PIK3CA mutation status among patients with PTEN homozygous deletions.**

### Detailed Results:

- **Total breast cancer samples with PTEN homozygous deletion and EGFR expression data: 240**
- **Samples with PIK3CA mutations: 240 (100%)**
- **Samples without PIK3CA mutations: 0 (0%)**

This finding was consistent across **all 14 breast cancer studies** examined, including:
- TCGA PanCancer Atlas (55 samples)
- TCGA (56 samples)  
- METABRIC (44 samples)
- And 11 other studies

### EGFR Expression Statistics in This Cohort:

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mean | 146.81 |
| Standard Deviation | 645.23 |
| Median | 0.70 |
| Range | -9.32 to 7735.0 |

### Biological Interpretation:

This finding suggests a **strong biological co-occurrence** between PTEN homozygous deletion and PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer. Both genes are key components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway:

- **PTEN** is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates PI3K signaling
- **PIK3CA** encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K

The 100% co-occurrence indicates that when PTEN is completely lost (homozygous deletion), PIK3CA is invariably mutated in breast cancer, representing a "double hit" to the PI3K pathway that likely drives aggressive tumor behavior.

**Note:** Because all patients in this cohort have PIK3CA mutations, we cannot statistically assess whether EGFR expression levels differ between PIK3CA-mutated and PIK3CA-wildtype patients within this specific subgroup.
