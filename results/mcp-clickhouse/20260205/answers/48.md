# Question 48

**Type:** Multi-omic Integration

**Question:** "What is the concordance between ERBB2 copy number amplification, mRNA overexpression, and protein overexpression in breast cancer?"

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the findings:

## ERBB2 (HER2) Concordance Analysis in Breast Cancer

Based on analysis of the **TCGA Breast Cancer PanCancer Atlas 2018** dataset with **863 samples** having complete data for all three molecular measurements:

### **Overall Prevalence:**
- **CNA Amplified** (GISTIC ≥ 2): 101 samples (11.7%)
- **mRNA Overexpressed** (Z-score > 2): 137 samples (15.9%)
- **Protein Overexpressed** (RPPA Z-score > 2): 52 samples (6.0%)
- **All three high**: 50 samples (5.8%)

### **Concordance Rates (Directional):**

| Relationship | Concordance | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **CNA Amplified → mRNA High** | **93.1%** (94/101) | Very high concordance: amplification almost always leads to mRNA overexpression |
| **CNA Amplified → Protein High** | **49.5%** (50/101) | Moderate concordance: only half of amplified cases show protein overexpression |
| **mRNA High → CNA Amplified** | **68.6%** (94/137) | Good concordance: most mRNA overexpression is driven by amplification |
| **mRNA High → Protein High** | **38.0%** (52/137) | Low concordance: mRNA doesn't reliably predict protein levels |
| **Protein High → CNA Amplified** | **96.2%** (50/52) | Very high concordance: protein overexpression almost always indicates amplification |
| **Protein High → mRNA High** | **100%** (52/52) | Perfect concordance: all protein-high cases have high mRNA |

### **Correlation Coefficients:**
- **CNA ↔ mRNA**: r = 0.558 (moderate positive correlation)
- **CNA ↔ Protein**: r = 0.636 (moderate-strong positive correlation)
- **mRNA ↔ Protein**: r = 0.758 (strong positive correlation)

### **Key Discordance Patterns:**

1. **CNA Amplified but mRNA NOT High**: 7 cases (6.9% of amplified)
   - Average mRNA Z-score: 1.02 (still elevated, just below threshold)
   
2. **mRNA High but CNA NOT Amplified**: 43 cases (31.4% of mRNA-high)
   - Average CNA: 0.65 (diploid/low gain)
   - Suggests alternative mechanisms of mRNA upregulation

3. **mRNA High but Protein NOT High**: 85 cases (62.0% of mRNA-high)
   - Average protein Z-score: 0.67
   - Indicates post-transcriptional regulation

---

### **Clinical Implications:**

1. **CNA amplification is highly predictive of mRNA overexpression** (93%), making it a reliable biomarker for transcriptional activation.

2. **Protein overexpression is the most specific marker** - when present, it almost always indicates both CNA amplification (96%) and mRNA overexpression (100%).

3. **mRNA-protein discordance is substantial** (62% of mRNA-high cases lack protein overexpression), highlighting the importance of:
   - Post-transcriptional regulation
   - Protein stability/degradation
   - Translation efficiency differences

4. **For HER2-targeted therapy selection**, protein expression (IHC/RPPA) may be more clinically relevant than mRNA levels alone, as it represents the actual therapeutic target.

5. **Alternative mechanisms** drive ~31% of mRNA overexpression cases without CNA amplification, suggesting transcriptional or epigenetic regulation.

This analysis demonstrates that while ERBB2 amplification strongly drives mRNA expression, the relationship between mRNA and protein levels is more complex, with significant post-transcriptional regulation affecting final protein abundance.
