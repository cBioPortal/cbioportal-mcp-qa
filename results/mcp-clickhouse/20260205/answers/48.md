# Question 48

**Type:** Multi-omic Integration

**Question:** "What is the concordance between ERBB2 copy number amplification, mRNA overexpression, and protein overexpression in breast cancer?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you analyze the concordance between ERBB2 (HER2) copy number amplification, mRNA overexpression, and protein overexpression in breast cancer. Let me start by exploring the available data.

Now let me check what breast cancer studies have the necessary data types (CNA, mRNA expression, and protein expression):



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n    cs.name,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT s.internal_id) as sample_count,\n    groupArray(DISTINCT gp.genetic_alteration_type) as data_types,\n    groupArray(DISTINCT gp.stable_id) as profile_ids\nFROM cancer_study cs\nJOIN genetic_profile gp ON cs.cancer_study_id = gp.cancer_study_id\nJOIN sample_profile sp ON gp.genetic_profile_id = sp.genetic_profile_id\nJOIN sample s ON sp.sample_id = s.internal_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%breast%'\n  AND gp.genetic_alteration_type IN ('COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION', 'MRNA_EXPRESSION', 'PROTEIN_LEVEL')\nGROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\nHAVING length(groupArray(DISTINCT gp.genetic_alteration_type)) >= 2\nORDER BY sample_count DESC\nLIMIT 10\n"

Let me check the TCGA breast cancer study and CPTAC studies which typically have multi-omic data:

Perfect! I can see that the TCGA breast cancer studies have all three data types. Let me use the PanCancer Atlas version which has the most comprehensive data. Now let me query for ERBB2 data across all three modalities:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json

Let me check the correct column names in the genetic_alteration_derived table:



Calling `clickhouse_list_table_columns` with args:
```json
{
  "table": "genetic_alteration_derived"

```



Result from `clickhouse_list_table_columns`:

```


Good! Now let me query with the correct column name:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Get all ERBB2 data across CNA, mRNA, and protein for the TCGA PanCancer Atlas breast cancer study\nWITH cna_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toInt32OrNull(alteration_value) as cna_value\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION'\n      AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\n),\nmrna_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value) as mrna_zscore\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'MRNA_EXPRESSION'\n      AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\n),\nprotein_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value) as protein_zscore\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'PROTEIN_LEVEL'\n      AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\n)\nSELECT \n    COALESCE(c.sample_unique_id, m.sample_unique_id, p.sample_unique_id) as sample_id,\n    c.cna_value,\n    m.mrna_zscore,\n    p.protein_zscore\nFROM cna_data c\nFULL OUTER JOIN mrna_data m ON c.sample_unique_id = m.sample_unique_id\nFULL OUTER JOIN protein_data p ON COALESCE(c.sample_unique_id, m.sample_unique_id) = p.sample_unique_id\nORDER BY sample_id\nLIMIT 20\n"

Let me check what profile_type values are actually available:

Great! Now I can see the profile types. Let me query the data correctly:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Get all ERBB2 data across CNA, mRNA, and protein for the TCGA PanCancer Atlas breast cancer study\nWITH cna_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toInt32OrNull(alteration_value) as cna_value\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'gistic'\n      AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\n),\nmrna_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value) as mrna_zscore\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores'\n      AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\n),\nprotein_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value) as protein_zscore\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'rppa_Zscores'\n      AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\n)\nSELECT \n    COALESCE(c.sample_unique_id, m.sample_unique_id, p.sample_unique_id) as sample_id,\n    c.cna_value,\n    m.mrna_zscore,\n    p.protein_zscore\nFROM cna_data c\nFULL OUTER JOIN mrna_data m ON c.sample_unique_id = m.sample_unique_id\nFULL OUTER JOIN protein_data p ON COALESCE(c.sample_unique_id, m.sample_unique_id) = p.sample_unique_id\nWHERE c.cna_value IS NOT NULL OR m.mrna_zscore IS NOT NULL OR p.protein_zscore IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY sample_id\nLIMIT 10\n"

```

The query is working but the FULL OUTER JOIN isn't working as expected. Let me try a different approach:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Get all samples with any ERBB2 data\nWITH all_samples AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type IN ('gistic', 'rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores', 'rppa_Zscores')\n),\ncna_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toInt32OrNull(alteration_value) as cna_value\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'gistic'\n),\nmrna_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value) as mrna_zscore\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores'\n),\nprotein_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        sample_unique_id,\n        toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value) as protein_zscore\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'ERBB2'\n      AND profile_type = 'rppa_Zscores'\n)\nSELECT \n    s.sample_unique_id,\n    c.cna_value,\n    m.mrna_zscore,\n    p.protein_zscore\nFROM all_samples s\nLEFT JOIN cna_data c ON s.sample_unique_id = c.sample_unique_id\nLEFT JOIN mrna_data m ON s.sample_unique_id = m.sample_unique_id\nLEFT JOIN protein_data p ON s.sample_unique_id = p.sample_unique_id\nORDER BY s.sample_unique_id\nLIMIT 20\n"
