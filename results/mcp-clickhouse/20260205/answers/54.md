# Question 54

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a detailed summary:

## Most Common KRAS Mutations in Colorectal Cancer

Based on analysis of **25 colorectal cancer studies** in cBioPortal (7,943 sequenced samples), KRAS mutations are found in **3,161 samples (39.8%)**.

### **Top 10 Most Common KRAS Mutations:**

| Rank | Mutation | Type | Samples | Studies |
|------|----------|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **G12D** | Missense | 920 | 24 |
| 2 | **G12V** | Missense | 640 | 24 |
| 3 | **G13D** | Missense | 571 | 23 |
| 4 | **G12C** | Missense | 233 | 21 |
| 5 | **A146T** | Missense | 208 | 21 |
| 6 | **G12A** | Missense | 142 | 19 |
| 7 | **G12S** | Missense | 123 | 17 |
| 8 | **Q61H** | Missense | 62 | 16 |
| 9 | **K117N** | Missense | 43 | 14 |
| 10 | **G12R** | Missense | 32 | 14 |

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Codon 12 dominates**: G12 mutations account for **2,076 samples (65.7% of all KRAS mutations)**
   - G12D, G12V, and G12C are the three most common variants

2. **Codon 13**: G13 mutations found in **599 samples (18.9%)**
   - G13D is the predominant variant

3. **Other hotspots**:
   - **Codon 146** (A146): 243 samples (7.7%)
   - **Codon 61** (Q61): 146 samples (4.6%)
   - **Codon 117** (K117): 47 samples (1.5%)

4. **Clinical relevance**: G12C mutations (233 samples) are particularly important as they are targetable by specific inhibitors like sotorasib and adagrasib.

All mutations are predominantly **missense mutations**, with rare nonsense and in-frame insertions also observed.
