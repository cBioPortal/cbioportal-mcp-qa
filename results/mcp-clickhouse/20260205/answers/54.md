# Question 54

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most common KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer. Let me query the database to get this information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    protein_change,\n    COUNT(*) as mutation_count,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as sample_count\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE hugo_gene_symbol = 'KRAS'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND sample_unique_id IN (\n        SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n        FROM clinical_data_derived\n        WHERE attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n            AND attribute_value LIKE '%Colorectal%'\n    )\n    AND protein_change != ''\nGROUP BY protein_change\nORDER BY mutation_count DESC\nLIMIT 20\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"error_message":"Query execution failed: Received ClickHouse exception, code: 47, server response: Code: 47. DB::Exception: Unknown expression identifier `protein_change` in scope SELECT protein_change, COUNT(*) AS mutation_count, COUNTDistinct(sample_unique_id) AS sample_count FROM genomic_event_derived WHERE (hugo_gene_symbol = 'KRAS') AND (variant_type = 'mutation') AND (cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024') AND (sample_unique_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id FROM clinical_data_derived WHERE (attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE') AND (attribute_value LIKE '%Colorectal%'))) AND (protein_change != '') GROUP BY protein_change ORDER BY mutation_count DESC LIMIT 20. (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER) (version 25.8.1.36912 (official build)) (for url https://dl96orhu96.us-east-1.aws.clickhouse.cloud:8443)"}
```


Let me check the correct column names in the genomic_event_derived table:



Calling `clickhouse_list_table_columns` with args:
```json
{
  "table": "genomic_event_derived"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_list_table_columns`:
```json
{"columns":[{"name":"sample_unique_id","type":"String","comment":"Globally unique sample identifier constructed as cancer_study_identifier + \"_\" + sample.stable_id to ensure uniqueness across all studies."},{"name":"hugo_gene_symbol","type":"String","comment":"Official HUGO gene symbol for the affected gene.

Determined by checking presence in gene_panel_to_gene_derived table."}]}
```


Now I can see the correct column is `mutation_variant`. Let me query again:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    mutation_variant,\n    mutation_type,\n    COUNT(*) as mutation_count,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as sample_count\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE hugo_gene_symbol = 'KRAS'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND sample_unique_id IN (\n        SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n        FROM clinical_data_derived\n        WHERE attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n            AND attribute_value LIKE '%Colorectal%'\n    )\n    AND mutation_variant != 'NA'\n    AND mutation_variant != ''\nGROUP BY mutation_variant, mutation_type\nORDER BY mutation_count DESC\nLIMIT 20\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"mutation_variant":"G12D","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":687,"sample_count":687},{"mutation_variant":"G12V","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":484,"sample_count":484},{"mutation_variant":"G13D","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":426,"sample_count":426},{"mutation_variant":"G12C","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":159,"sample_count":159},{"mutation_variant":"A146T","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":140,"sample_count":140},{"mutation_variant":"G12S","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":109,"sample_count":109},{"mutation_variant":"G12A","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":106,"sample_count":106},{"mutation_variant":"Q61H","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":53,"sample_count":53},{"mutation_variant":"A146V","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":27,"sample_count":27},{"mutation_variant":"G12R","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":26,"sample_count":26},{"mutation_variant":"K117N","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":26,"sample_count":26},{"mutation_variant":"Q61K","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":22,"sample_count":22},{"mutation_variant":"G13C","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":20,"sample_count":20},{"mutation_variant":"Q61R","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":15,"sample_count":15},{"mutation_variant":"A59T","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":13,"sample_count":13},{"mutation_variant":"V14I","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":10,"sample_count":10},{"mutation_variant":"A146P","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":9,"sample_count":9},{"mutation_variant":"Q61L","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":7,"sample_count":7},{"mutation_variant":"D33E","mutation_type":"Missense_Mutation","mutation_count":6,"sample_count":6},{"mutation_variant":"G10dup","mutation_type":"In_Frame_Ins","mutation_count":5,"sample_count":5}]}
```


Perfect! Let me also get the total number of colorectal cancer samples to provide context:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as total_colorectal_samples,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN hugo_gene_symbol = 'KRAS' AND variant_type = 'mutation' THEN sample_unique_id END) as samples_with_kras_mutation\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nLEFT JOIN genomic_event_derived USING (sample_unique_id)\nWHERE attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n    AND attribute_value LIKE '%Colorectal%'\n    AND cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_colorectal_samples":5543,"samples_with_kras_mutation":2355}]}
```


## Most Common KRAS Mutations in Colorectal Cancer

Based on the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the most common KRAS mutations found in colorectal cancer:

### Top 10 KRAS Mutations:

1. **G12D** - 687 samples (29.2% of KRAS-mutant samples)
2. **G12V** - 484 samples (20.5%)
3. **G13D** - 426 samples (18.1%)
4. **G12C** - 159 samples (6.8%)
5. **A146T** - 140 samples (5.9%)
6. **G12S** - 109 samples (4.6%)
7. **G12A** - 106 samples (4.5%)
8. **Q61H** - 53 samples (2.3%)
9. **A146V** - 27 samples (1.1%)
10. **G12R** - 26 samples (1.1%)

### Key Findings:

- **Overall KRAS mutation rate**: 42.5% (2,355 out of 5,543 colorectal cancer samples)
- **Codon 12 mutations dominate**: G12D, G12V, G12C, G12S, G12A, and G12R together account for the vast majority of KRAS mutations
- **G12D is the most common**: Nearly 30% of all KRAS-mutant colorectal cancers carry this specific mutation
- **All top mutations are missense mutations**: These are single amino acid substitutions that activate KRAS signaling

The classic "hotspot" codons (12, 13, and 61) account for most KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer, with codon 12 mutations being particularly prevalent. The A146T/V mutations represent a less common but notable alternative site of KRAS activation.
