# Question 69

**Type:** Identify Patients Molecularly

**Question:** Which patients have a TP53 G199V mutation? Which are somatic vs germline?

**Answer:**

## Summary: TP53 G199V Mutation

I found **130 unique patients** with the TP53 G199V mutation across multiple cancer studies in cBioPortal.

### Somatic vs Germline Breakdown:

| Mutation Status | Unique Patients | Samples |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Somatic** (SOMATIC + Somatic) | **95** | **100** |
| **Germline** | **1** | **1** |
| **Unknown/Not Available** (NA, ".", UNKNOWN) | **36** | **37** |

### Key Findings:

1. **Predominantly Somatic**: The vast majority (95 out of 130 patients, ~73%) have this mutation classified as somatic, meaning it was acquired in tumor tissue rather than inherited.

2. **Single Germline Case**: Only 1 patient (TCGA-A2-A0SX from brca_tcga_pub) has this mutation classified as germline, meaning it was inherited.

3. **Missing Data**: About 28% of cases have unknown or unavailable mutation status information (marked as "NA", ".", or "UNKNOWN").

4. **Cancer Types**: This mutation appears across multiple cancer types including:
   - Breast cancer (BRCA)
   - Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)
   - Colorectal cancer (CRC/COAD)
   - Prostate cancer (PRAD)
   - Bladder cancer (BLCA)
   - Glioblastoma (GBM)
   - And others

The TP53 G199V mutation is a missense mutation that appears to be predominantly a somatic alteration acquired during cancer development rather than an inherited germline variant.
