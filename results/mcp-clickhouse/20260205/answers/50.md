# Question 50

**Type:** Pathway Enrichment

**Question:** "Are mutations in DNA repair pathway genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2) enriched in specific cancer types across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas?"

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a detailed analysis:

## DNA Repair Pathway Gene Mutations Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas

Based on the analysis of mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2 across 32 TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, **DNA repair pathway gene mutations show significant enrichment in specific cancer types**.

### Key Findings:

**Overall Mutation Landscape:**
- **ATM**: Most frequently mutated (554 samples across 29 studies, 760 total mutations)
- **BRCA2**: Second most common (453 samples across 27 studies, 679 mutations)
- **BRCA1**: Third (266 samples across 21 studies, 300 mutations)
- **CHEK2**: Least common (127 samples across 25 studies, 141 mutations)

### Top 10 Cancer Types with DNA Repair Gene Enrichment:

| Rank | Cancer Type | Any DNA Repair Mutation | BRCA1 | BRCA2 | ATM | CHEK2 |
|------|-------------|------------------------|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| **1** | **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)** | **26.09%** (138/529) | 8.88% | 15.12% | 18.71% | 6.43% |
| **2** | **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA)** | **24.57%** (101/411) | 5.11% | 9.73% | 13.38% | 2.43% |
| **3** | **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM)** | **23.44%** (105/448) | 6.25% | 11.38% | 9.38% | 1.12% |
| **4** | **Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD)** | **18.41%** (81/440) | 3.64% | 8.64% | 9.55% | 1.82% |
| **5** | **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** | **17.84%** (101/566) | 3.71% | 5.48% | 8.30% | 1.77% |
| **6** | **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)** | **16.43%** (80/487) | 4.11% | 5.95% | 5.95% | 1.44% |
| **7** | **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD)** | **16.33%** (97/594) | 2.69% | 6.40% | 11.78% | 1.52% |
| **8** | **Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CESC)** | **12.79%** (38/297) | 4.71% | 4.38% | 3.70% | 1.35% |
| **9** | **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC)** | **9.94%** (52/523) | 2.10% | 4.02% | 3.25% | 0.76% |
| **10** | **Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (ESCA)** | **9.89%** (18/182) | 1.10% | 3.85% | 4.95% | 0.55% |

### Notable Patterns:

**1. Endometrial Cancer (UCEC)** shows the highest enrichment:
- Over 1 in 4 samples have DNA repair mutations
- ATM (18.71%) and BRCA2 (15.12%) are particularly enriched
- Consistent with known DNA repair defects in endometrial cancer

**2. Bladder Cancer (BLCA)** and **Melanoma (SKCM)** show ~24% mutation rates:
- High mutation burden cancers with significant DNA repair defects
- All four genes show substantial mutation frequencies

**3. Gastrointestinal Cancers** (STAD, COADREAD, ESCA):
- Show moderate to high enrichment (9.89-18.41%)
- ATM mutations particularly common in colorectal cancer (11.78%)

**4. Lung Cancers** (LUAD, LUSC):
- Both show ~16-18% mutation rates
- Reflects high mutational burden from carcinogen exposure

**5. Lower Enrichment in:**
- **Breast Cancer (BRCA)**: Only 7.75% despite BRCA1/2 being canonical breast cancer genes (germline vs somatic distinction)
- **Ovarian Cancer (OV)**: 7.69% (similar germline/somatic consideration)
- **Brain Tumors** (GBM, LGG): <3% (different mutational mechanisms)
- **Hematologic Malignancies** (LAML): 1.5%

### Clinical Implications:

These enrichment patterns suggest:
1. **Therapeutic opportunities**: High DNA repair mutation rates in UCEC, BLCA, and SKCM may predict PARP inhibitor sensitivity
2. **Immunotherapy response**: DNA repair defects often correlate with high tumor mutational burden and immunotherapy response
3. **Cancer-specific biology**: Different cancer types show distinct DNA repair gene mutation profiles reflecting their etiology

This analysis demonstrates clear enrichment of DNA repair pathway mutations in specific TCGA cancer types, with endometrial, bladder, and melanoma showing the highest frequencies.
