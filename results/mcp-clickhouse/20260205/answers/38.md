# Question 38

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Expression

**Question:** Do lung adenocarcinoma patients with high EGFR mRNA expression (top quartile) have different survival outcomes than those with low expression?

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now let me create a comprehensive summary of the findings:

## Analysis Results: EGFR mRNA Expression and Survival in Lung Adenocarcinoma

Based on the **TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma PanCancer Atlas 2018** dataset, I analyzed survival outcomes for patients with high vs. low EGFR mRNA expression levels.

### Study Population
- **Total patients analyzed:** 256 patients (128 in each group)
- **Low expression group (Q1):** EGFR expression ≤ 539.15 (range: 12.52 - 538.39)
- **High expression group (Q4):** EGFR expression ≥ 1766.05 (range: 1,772.42 - 24,089.10)

### Key Survival Findings

| Metric | Low EGFR (Q1) | High EGFR (Q4) | Difference |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Median OS** | 23.14 months | 20.37 months | +2.77 months (favors low) |
| **Mean OS** | 34.06 months | 27.49 months | +6.57 months (favors low) |
| **Q1-Q3 OS range** | 13.20 - 43.22 months | 11.82 - 37.55 months | Wider range in low group |
| **Mortality rate** | 38.58% (49/127) | 40.48% (51/126) | 1.9% lower in low group |
| **Living patients** | 79/127 (62.2%) | 77/126 (61.1%) | Similar |

### Clinical Interpretation

**The data suggests a modest survival advantage for patients with LOW EGFR mRNA expression:**

1. **Median survival difference:** Patients with low EGFR expression survived ~2.8 months longer (median), though this difference is relatively modest.

2. **Mean survival difference:** The mean survival shows a larger difference of ~6.6 months favoring the low expression group, suggesting some patients with low EGFR expression may have substantially longer survival.

3. **Mortality rates:** Very similar between groups (38.6% vs 40.5%), indicating the survival difference is not driven by dramatically different death rates but rather by timing of events.

4. **Survival distribution:** The low EGFR group shows a wider interquartile range (13.2-43.2 vs 11.8-37.6 months), suggesting more heterogeneity in outcomes.

### Tumor Stage Distribution

The stage distribution is relatively balanced between groups:
- **Stage I (IA+IB):** Low = 69 patients, High = 62 patients
- **Stage II (IIA+IIB):** Low = 34 patients, High = 35 patients  
- **Stage III (IIIA+IIIB):** Low = 21 patients, High = 23 patients
- **Stage IV:** Low = 4 patients, High = 8 patients

The high EGFR group has slightly more advanced disease (more Stage IV), which could partially explain the survival difference.

### Important Caveats

1. **Statistical significance not tested:** This analysis shows descriptive statistics only. Formal statistical testing (log-rank test, Cox regression) would be needed to determine if differences are statistically significant.

2. **Confounding factors:** Stage distribution and other clinical variables may confound the relationship between EGFR expression and survival.

3. **Research data only:** This represents published research data and should not be used for clinical decision-making.
