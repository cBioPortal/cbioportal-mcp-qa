# Question 32

**Type:** Hotspot Mutation Analysis

**Question:** What are the most frequent EGFR mutation variants in lung adenocarcinoma and what percentage are known hotspot mutations?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have all the information needed to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me compile the results:

## Most Frequent EGFR Mutation Variants in Lung Adenocarcinoma

Based on the cBioPortal database analysis of **8,049 lung adenocarcinoma samples with EGFR mutations**, here are the findings:

### Top 10 Most Frequent EGFR Variants:

1. **L858R** (Exon 21) - 2,674 samples (33.2%)
2. **E746_A750del** (Exon 19 deletion) - 2,232 samples (27.7%)
3. **T790M** (Exon 20) - 706 samples (8.8%)
4. **L747_P753delinsS** (Exon 19 deletion) - 270 samples (3.4%)
5. **L861Q** (Exon 21) - 247 samples (3.1%)
6. **G719A** (Exon 18) - 238 samples (3.0%)
7. **S768I** (Exon 20) - 214 samples (2.7%)
8. **L747_T751del** (Exon 19 deletion) - 199 samples (2.5%)
9. **L747_A750delinsP** (Exon 19 deletion) - 158 samples (2.0%)
10. **E746_S752delinsV** (Exon 19 deletion) - 133 samples (1.7%)

### Hotspot Mutation Categories:

| Category | Samples | Percentage |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Exon 19 deletions** | 3,605 | 44.8% |
| **Exon 21 L858R** | 2,674 | 33.2% |
| **Exon 20 T790M** (resistance) | 706 | 8.8% |
| **Exon 18 G719X** | 425 | 5.3% |
| **Exon 20 insertions** | 314 | 3.9% |
| **Exon 21 L861Q** | 247 | 3.1% |
| **Exon 20 S768I** | 214 | 2.7% |
| **Other variants** | 1,512 | 18.8% |

### **Hotspot Mutation Percentage: 84.8%**

**84.8% of all EGFR mutations** in lung adenocarcinoma occur at known hotspot locations (8,454 out of 9,966 total mutations). The two most common hotspots—Exon 19 deletions and L858R—together account for **78% of all EGFR mutations** in lung adenocarcinoma.

These hotspot mutations are clinically significant as they are typically sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while T790M is a well-known resistance mutation that emerges after TKI treatment.
