# Question 53

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** How many patients have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the number of patients with EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study. Let me start by finding the correct study identifier.



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```


Let me search more broadly for TCGA lung studies:



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "lung adenocarcinoma"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```


Let me query the database directly to find TCGA lung adenocarcinoma studies:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT cancer_study_identifier, name, description \nFROM cancer_study \nWHERE name ILIKE '%lung%adenocarcinoma%' AND name ILIKE '%TCGA%'\nLIMIT 10"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"cancer_study_identifier":"luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018","name":"Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)","description":"Lung Adenocarcinoma TCGA PanCancer data. The original data is <a href=\"https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas\">here</a>.

```


Great! I found several TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma studies. The most commonly used one is the PanCancer Atlas version. Now let me query for patients with EGFR amplification. I'll check the most recent PanCancer Atlas study first:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.internal_id) as patient_count\nFROM cna c\nJOIN sample s ON c.sample_id = s.internal_id\nJOIN patient p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  AND c.hugo_gene_symbol = 'EGFR'\n  AND c.alteration = 2"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"error_message":"Query execution failed: Received ClickHouse exception, code: 60, server response: Code: 60. DB::Exception: Unknown table expression identifier 'cna' in scope SELECT COUNTDistinct(p.internal_id) AS patient_count FROM cna AS c INNER JOIN sample AS s ON c.sample_id = s.internal_id INNER JOIN patient AS p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id INNER JOIN cancer_study AS cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id WHERE (cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018') AND (c.hugo_gene_symbol = 'EGFR') AND (c.alteration = 2).

```


Let me check what tables are available:

Perfect! I can see there's a `genomic_event_derived` table that includes CNA data. Let me query for EGFR amplifications:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'EGFR'\n  AND variant_type = 'cna'\n  AND alteration = 2"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"error_message":"Query execution failed: Received ClickHouse exception, code: 47, server response: Code: 47. DB::Exception: Unknown expression or function identifier `alteration` in scope SELECT COUNTDistinct(patient_unique_id) AS patient_count FROM genomic_event_derived WHERE (cancer_study_identifier = 'luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018') AND (hugo_gene_symbol = 'EGFR') AND (variant_type = 'cna') AND (alteration = 2). (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER) (version 25.8.1.36912 (official build)) (for url https://dl96orhu96.us-east-1.aws.clickhouse.cloud:8443)"}
```


Let me check the columns in the genomic_event_derived table:



Calling `clickhouse_list_table_columns` with args:
```json
{
  "table": "genomic_event_derived"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_list_table_columns`:

```


Perfect! The column is called `cna_alteration`, not `alteration`. Let me query again:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patient_count\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'EGFR'\n  AND variant_type = 'cna'\n  AND cna_alteration = 2"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"patient_count":26}]}
```


Perfect! **26 patients** have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma (PanCancer Atlas) study.

To clarify: In copy number alteration data, a value of `2` represents amplification (high-level gain), while `-2` represents deep deletion. This query identified all patients with EGFR amplification in the `luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018` study.
