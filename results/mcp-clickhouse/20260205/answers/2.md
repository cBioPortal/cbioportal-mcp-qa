# Question 2

**Type:** Study Discovery

**Question:** How many glioblastoma studies are in cBioPortal?

**Answer:**

Based on my search of the cBioPortal database, there are **24 studies** related to glioblastoma and gliomas.

These studies include:
- **Glioblastoma-specific studies** (GBM): Multiple TCGA datasets, Columbia, CPTAC, and Mayo Clinic PDX studies
- **Lower-grade glioma studies** (LGG): TCGA and UCSF datasets
- **Diffuse glioma studies**: GLASS Consortium, MSK, and merged LGG/GBM cohorts
- **IDH-mutated gliomas**: MSK 2023 study
- **Oligodendroglioma studies**: MSK 2017 study

The most comprehensive studies include:
- Merged Cohort of LGG and GBM (TCGA, Cell 2016) - 1,122 tumor/normal pairs
- Glioma (MSK, Clin Cancer Res 2019) - 1,004 samples from 923 patients
- Glioblastoma (TCGA, Cell 2013) - 291 tumor/normal pairs

Note: The search also returned a few non-glioma studies (pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and urothelial carcinoma) that matched the search terms but are not glioblastoma studies. The actual glioblastoma/glioma-specific count is approximately **18-19 studies**.
