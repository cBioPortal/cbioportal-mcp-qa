**Answer:**

Perfect! Now let me compile this comprehensive analysis:

## Key Genomic Differences Between Lung Adenocarcinomas and Squamous Cell Carcinomas in the Pan-Lung Cancer TCGA Study

Based on the Pan-Lung Cancer TCGA study (nsclc_tcga_broad_2016) with **660 lung adenocarcinomas (ADC)** and **484 lung squamous cell carcinomas (SqCC)**, here are the major genomic differences:

### **1. TP53 Mutation Frequency - Major Difference**
- **Lung Adenocarcinoma**: 54.1% (357/660 samples)
- **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: 86.4% (418/484 samples)
- **Key Finding**: TP53 mutations are significantly more common in squamous cell carcinomas

### **2. Oncogenic Driver Mutations - Highly Distinctive**

**Adenocarcinoma-Enriched Mutations:**
- **KRAS**: 32.4% in ADC vs 1.7% in SqCC (19x higher)
- **EGFR**: 15.8% in ADC vs 2.7% in SqCC (6x higher)
- **STK11**: 15.8% in ADC vs 1.4% in SqCC (11x higher)
- **KEAP1**: 16.7% in ADC vs 10.7% in SqCC
- **BRAF**: 8.2% in ADC vs 3.3% in SqCC
- **ALK**: 5.0% in ADC vs 3.7% in SqCC

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma-Enriched Mutations:**
- **CDKN2A**: 15.5% in SqCC vs rare in ADC
- **NFE2L2**: 14.5% in SqCC vs rare in ADC
- **PIK3CA**: 11.4% in SqCC vs lower in ADC
- **PTEN**: 11.6% in SqCC vs lower in ADC

### **3. Copy Number Alterations - Dramatic Differences**

**Adenocarcinoma-Specific Amplifications:**
- **NKX2-1**: 12.0% in ADC vs 2.7% in SqCC (lineage marker)
- **KRAS**: 6.1% amplification in ADC vs 3.7% in SqCC
- **MYC**: 9.4% in ADC vs 7.9% in SqCC

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma-Specific Amplifications:**
- **SOX2**: 42.4% in SqCC vs 2.3% in ADC (18x higher!)
- **TP63**: 33.7% in SqCC vs 2.0% in ADC (17x higher!)
- **PIK3CA**: 40.1% in SqCC vs 2.1% in ADC (19x higher!)
- **FGFR1**: 17.1% in SqCC vs 2.9% in ADC (6x higher)
- **CCND1**: 13.0% in SqCC vs 3.9% in ADC (3x higher)

**Common Deletions (both subtypes):**
- **CDKN2A/CDKN2B**: Deep deletions in 17.0%/16.4% of ADC and 26.7%/26.7% of SqCC

### **4. Chromatin Remodeling and Epigenetic Regulators**

**Adenocarcinoma:**
- **SMARCA4**: 9.2% mutated
- **ARID1A**: 7.3% mutated
- **RBM10**: 6.2% mutated (X-linked splicing factor)
- **SETD2**: 5.8% mutated

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma:**
- **KMT2C**: 16.1% mutated (higher than ADC)
- **CREBBP**: 7.0% mutated
- **EP300**: 4.5% mutated

### **5. Structural Variants**
- More common in adenocarcinomas (30 samples with SVs) vs squamous cell carcinomas (12 samples with SVs)

### **Summary of Key Distinctions:**

**Lung Adenocarcinoma** is characterized by:
- Targetable driver mutations (KRAS, EGFR, ALK, BRAF)
- NKX2-1 amplification (lung lineage marker)
- Lower TP53 mutation rate
- More structural variants
- RBM10 mutations (splicing)

**Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma** is characterized by:
- Very high TP53 mutation rate (86%)
- Squamous lineage amplifications (SOX2, TP63)
- PI3K pathway alterations (PIK3CA amplification/mutation, PTEN loss)
- FGFR1 amplifications
- NFE2L2 mutations (oxidative stress response)
- CDKN2A deletions more common

These genomic differences reflect the distinct cell-of-origin, biology, and therapeutic vulnerabilities of these two major lung cancer subtypes.
