# Question 45

**Type:** Subtype-specific Alterations

**Question:** What are the most frequently mutated genes in copy-number high subtype endometrial cancers compared to other subtypes?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me create a summary of the findings:

## Most Frequently Mutated Genes in Copy-Number High Subtype Endometrial Cancers

Based on analysis of **223 copy-number high samples** compared to **516 samples from other subtypes** (CN-low, MSI, and POLE) from TCGA endometrial cancer studies:

### **Genes Significantly ENRICHED in Copy-Number High Subtype:**

| Gene | CN-High Frequency | Other Subtypes Frequency | Difference |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **TP53** | **87.9%** (196/223) | 12.0% (62/516) | **+75.9%** |
| **PPP2R1A** | **28.3%** (63/223) | 9.3% (48/516) | **+18.9%** |
| FBXW7 | 19.3% (43/223) | 17.2% (89/516) | +2.0% |

### **Genes Significantly DEPLETED in Copy-Number High Subtype:**

| Gene | CN-High Frequency | Other Subtypes Frequency | Difference |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **PTEN** | 15.2% (34/223) | **86.2%** (445/516) | **-71.0%** |
| **ARID1A** | 4.9% (11/223) | **56.4%** (291/516) | **-51.5%** |
| **TTN** | 17.0% (38/223) | 46.3% (239/516) | -29.3% |
| **KMT2D** | 5.4% (12/223) | 31.8% (164/516) | -26.4% |
| **PIK3R1** | 13.9% (31/223) | 38.8% (200/516) | -24.9% |
| **PIK3CA** | 36.8% (82/223) | 57.2% (295/516) | -20.4% |
| **KRAS** | 4.5% (10/223) | 25.8% (133/516) | -21.3% |

### **Key Findings:**

1. **TP53 is the hallmark of copy-number high endometrial cancer**, mutated in nearly 88% of cases compared to only 12% in other subtypes - a dramatic 76 percentage point difference.

2. **PPP2R1A** (protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit A) is the second most enriched gene, mutated in 28% of CN-high cases vs 9% in others.

3. **PTEN and ARID1A are strongly depleted** in CN-high subtype, being characteristic of the endometrioid/CN-low subtypes instead. PTEN mutations occur in 86% of other subtypes but only 15% of CN-high.

4. **PI3K pathway genes** (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN) show contrasting patterns - PTEN is depleted while PIK3CA and PIK3R1 are still present but at lower frequencies in CN-high.

5. The copy-number high subtype (also called "serous-like") has a distinct mutational profile dominated by TP53 mutations, reflecting its more aggressive biology and similarity to serous carcinomas.
