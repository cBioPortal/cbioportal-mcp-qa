# Question 6

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

## Top 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in TARGET Osteosarcoma Study

Based on the **Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)** study with 141 samples, here are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes:

| Rank | Gene | Mutated Samples | Mutation Frequency | Total Mutations |
|------|------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 32 | 22.7% | 33 |
| 2 | **TTN** | 16 | 11.3% | 18 |
| 3 | **MUC16** | 16 | 11.3% | 17 |
| 4 | **ATRX** | 11 | 7.8% | 11 |
| 5 | **DNAH9** | 10 | 7.1% | 10 |

### Key Findings:

- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in nearly 23% of osteosarcoma samples, which is consistent with its well-known role as a tumor suppressor in many cancers including osteosarcoma.

- **TTN** (Titin) and **MUC16** (Mucin 16) are tied for second place with mutations in 11.3% of samples. These are very large genes and are often found mutated in cancer sequencing studies, though not all mutations may be functionally significant.

- **ATRX** (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked) is mutated in 7.8% of samples and is known to be involved in chromatin remodeling and telomere maintenance.

- **DNAH9** (Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain 9) rounds out the top 5 with mutations in 7.1% of samples.
