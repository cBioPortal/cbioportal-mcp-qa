# Question 6

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET. Let me first search for the correct study identifier.



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "osteosarcoma TARGET"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```


Let me try a broader search:



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "osteosarcoma"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```




Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "TARGET"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json
[{"cancer_study_identifier":"aml_target_gdc","name":"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"aml","sample_count":2767,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"all_phase2_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Acute Lymphoid Leukemia - Phase II (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"bll","sample_count":1979,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"nbl_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"nbl","sample_count":1090,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"aml_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"aml","sample_count":1026,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"bll_target_gdc","name":"B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"bll","sample_count":990,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"wt_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Wilms' Tumor (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"wt","sample_count":658,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"nbl_target_gdc","name":"Neuroblastoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"nbl","sample_count":534,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"alal_target_gdc","name":"Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"alal","sample_count":252,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"os","sample_count":160,"has_guide":true},{"cancer_study_identifier":"wt_target_gdc","name":"Wilms' Tumor (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"wt","sample_count":133,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"rt_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Rhabdoid Tumor (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"mrt","sample_count":73,"has_guide":false}]
```


Perfect! I found the study: "os_target_gdc" (Osteosarcoma from TARGET GDC, 2025). Now let me query for the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in this study.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as num_samples_mutated,\n    COUNT(*) as total_mutations\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'os_target_gdc'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol != ''\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY num_samples_mutated DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TP53","num_samples_mutated":32,"total_mutations":33},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"MUC16","num_samples_mutated":16,"total_mutations":17},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TTN","num_samples_mutated":16,"total_mutations":18},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"ATRX","num_samples_mutated":11,"total_mutations":11},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"DNAH9","num_samples_mutated":10,"total_mutations":10}]}
```


Excellent! Here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes** in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET (TARGET GDC, 2025):

1. **TP53** - 32 samples mutated (33 total mutations)
2. **MUC16** - 16 samples mutated (17 total mutations)
3. **TTN** - 16 samples mutated (18 total mutations)
4. **ATRX** - 11 samples mutated (11 total mutations)
5. **DNAH9** - 10 samples mutated (10 total mutations)

**Key findings:**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in 32 samples, which is consistent with its well-known role as a tumor suppressor in many cancers including osteosarcoma.
- **MUC16** and **TTN** are tied for second place with mutations in 16 samples each. These genes are often mutated due to their large size.
- **ATRX** mutations are found in 11 samples - this gene is involved in chromatin remodeling and telomere maintenance.
- **DNAH9** rounds out the top 5 with mutations in 10 samples.

The study contains 160 samples total, so TP53 mutations are present in 20% of the osteosarcoma samples in this cohort.
