# Question 60

**Type:** Expression comparison

**Question:** In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have a good list. Let me get the top 5 with the most significant down-regulation in well-expressed genes:

## Summary

Based on my analysis of the **Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)** study, I identified the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated samples:

### Top 5 Down-Regulated Genes in TP53 Mutated Samples:

1. **CPB1** (Carboxypeptidase B1)
   - Average expression in TP53 mutated: 4,393.71 RSEM
   - Average expression in TP53 wild-type: 50,615.89 RSEM
   - Log2 fold change: **-3.526**
   - Percent change: **-91.3%**

2. **NPY1R** (Neuropeptide Y Receptor Y1)
   - Average expression in TP53 mutated: 1,084.79 RSEM
   - Average expression in TP53 wild-type: 7,406.79 RSEM
   - Log2 fold change: **-2.771**
   - Percent change: **-85.4%**

3. **SCUBE2** (Signal Peptide, CUB Domain And EGF Like Domain Containing 2)
   - Average expression in TP53 mutated: 1,645.13 RSEM
   - Average expression in TP53 wild-type: 10,252.92 RSEM
   - Log2 fold change: **-2.640**
   - Percent change: **-84.0%**

4. **SCGB1D2** (Secretoglobin Family 1D Member 2)
   - Average expression in TP53 mutated: 1,636.79 RSEM
   - Average expression in TP53 wild-type: 8,086.92 RSEM
   - Log2 fold change: **-2.305**
   - Percent change: **-79.8%**

5. **STC2** (Stanniocalcin 2)
   - Average expression in TP53 mutated: 3,276.36 RSEM
   - Average expression in TP53 wild-type: 15,205.64 RSEM
   - Log2 fold change: **-2.214**
   - Percent change: **-78.5%**

### Study Details:
- **Total samples analyzed**: 1,082
- **TP53 mutated samples**: 347 (32%)
- **TP53 wild-type samples**: 735 (68%)
- **Expression data**: RNA-Seq V2 RSEM normalized values

These genes show substantial down-regulation in TP53 mutated breast cancer samples and have meaningful expression levels in the wild-type samples, making them biologically relevant candidates for further investigation.
