# Question 40

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the most frequently altered genes in KRAS wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients?

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a clear summary of the findings:

## Most Frequently Altered Genes in KRAS Wild-Type Lung Adenocarcinoma

Based on analysis of **5,975 KRAS wild-type samples** from lung adenocarcinoma studies in cBioPortal (out of 8,125 total LUAD samples, with 2,150 being KRAS-mutated):

### Top Altered Genes in KRAS Wild-Type LUAD:

| Gene | Total Altered | % of Samples | Mutations | CNAs | Key Notes |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------|------|-----------|
| **TP53** | 3,008 | 50.3% | 2,971 | 42 | Most frequently mutated |
| **EGFR** | 2,379 | 39.8% | 2,241 | 548 | **Highly enriched in KRAS-WT** (vs 3% in KRAS-mut) |
| **CDKN2A** | 954 | 16.0% | 247 | 704 | Primarily deletions |
| **TTN** | 772 | 12.9% | 769 | 19 | Large gene, often passenger |
| **CDKN2B** | 686 | 11.5% | 5 | 680 | Primarily deletions |
| **MUC16** | 649 | 10.9% | 642 | 12 | Large gene, often passenger |
| **KEAP1** | 637 | 10.7% | 607 | 30 | Tumor suppressor |
| **STK11** | 611 | 10.2% | 553 | 46 | Tumor suppressor |
| **NF1** | 518 | 8.7% | 477 | 35 | Tumor suppressor |
| **RBM10** | 476 | 8.0% | 421 | 59 | RNA splicing factor |
| **MET** | 470 | 7.9% | 272 | 193 | Receptor tyrosine kinase |
| **BRAF** | 446 | 7.5% | 381 | 55 | **Enriched in KRAS-WT** (vs 2.9% in KRAS-mut) |
| **SMARCA4** | 427 | 7.1% | 386 | 32 | Chromatin remodeling |
| **ALK** | 394 | 6.6% | 216 | 17 | **Fusion driver, KRAS-WT specific** |
| **ERBB2** | 382 | 6.4% | 246 | 156 | HER2, targetable |
| **PIK3CA** | 377 | 6.3% | 331 | 49 | PI3K pathway |
| **SETD2** | 356 | 6.0% | 344 | 7 | Histone methyltransferase |

### Key Findings:

1. **EGFR is dramatically enriched in KRAS wild-type tumors** (39.8% vs 3.0% in KRAS-mutated), reflecting mutual exclusivity between KRAS and EGFR mutations.

2. **BRAF mutations are also enriched in KRAS-WT** (7.5% vs 2.9%), consistent with their role as alternative drivers in the MAPK pathway.

3. **ALK fusions** (6.6%) are essentially exclusive to KRAS wild-type tumors, representing an important targetable driver.

4. **TP53 is the most commonly altered gene** overall (50.3%), though it's even more frequent in KRAS-mutated tumors (36.9%).

5. **STK11 and KEAP1** are common co-alterations, though they're actually MORE frequent in KRAS-mutated tumors (STK11: 28.2% vs 10.2%; KEAP1: 20.6% vs 10.7%).

6. **Targetable alterations in KRAS-WT LUAD** include EGFR mutations/amplifications, ALK fusions, BRAF mutations, MET alterations, ERBB2 mutations/amplifications, and RET/ROS1 fusions.

This data reflects the molecular heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinoma and highlights the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling to identify actionable alterations in KRAS wild-type patients.
