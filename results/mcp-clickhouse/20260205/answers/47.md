# Question 47

**Type:** Cross-Study Expression Comparison

**Question:** How does ERBB2 mRNA expression vary across different cancer types in TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the key findings:

## ERBB2 mRNA Expression Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas Studies

Based on the analysis of **32 TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies** encompassing over **10,000 tumor samples**, here are the key findings regarding ERBB2 (HER2) mRNA expression:

### **Top Cancer Types by Mean ERBB2 Expression:**

1. **Breast Invasive Carcinoma** - Mean: 4,546 (1,082 samples)
   - Highest overall expression with extreme variability (range: -3.84 to 380,668)
   - 24.8% of samples show high expression (>1,000)
   - **7.4% show very high expression (>10,000)** - highest among all cancer types

2. **Stomach Adenocarcinoma** - Mean: 3,790 (412 samples)
   - Second highest mean expression
   - Wide range up to 415,387

3. **Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Mean: 3,782 (294 samples)
   - 33.0% high expressors (>1,000)
   - 3.2% very high expressors (>10,000)

4. **Esophageal Adenocarcinoma** - Mean: 3,436 (181 samples)
   - Gastrointestinal cancer with elevated ERBB2

5. **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma** - Mean: 3,408 (407 samples)
   - 24.8% high expressors
   - **8.8% very high expressors** - second highest percentage

### **Key Observations:**

**High Expression Prevalence:**
- **Ovarian, Uterine Carcinosarcoma, and Cervical cancers** show the highest percentage (~33%) of samples with expression >1,000
- **Breast cancer** has the highest percentage (7.4%) of very high expressors (>10,000), consistent with HER2+ breast cancer subtype
- **Bladder cancer** shows 8.8% very high expressors, suggesting potential therapeutic relevance

**Low Expression Cancer Types:**
- **Acute Myeloid Leukemia** - Mean: 28 (lowest)
- **Adrenocortical Carcinoma** - Mean: 92
- **Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma** - Mean: 95
- **Brain tumors** (GBM, LGG) - Mean: 437 and 269 respectively

**Expression Variability:**
- Most cancer types show **extreme variability** with standard deviations often exceeding the mean
- This reflects the presence of distinct molecular subtypes within each cancer type
- Median values are typically much lower than means, indicating right-skewed distributions with a subset of high expressors

### **Clinical Implications:**

The data reveals that while **breast cancer** is most commonly associated with ERBB2/HER2 amplification and overexpression, several other cancer types show substantial ERBB2 expression:
- **Gastroesophageal cancers** (stomach, esophageal)
- **Gynecologic cancers** (cervical, uterine, ovarian)
- **Bladder cancer**

These findings support the rationale for HER2-targeted therapies beyond breast cancer, which has led to FDA approvals for HER2-targeted agents in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers.
