# Question 12

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** What is the most common cancer type in the MSK-CHORD Study based on sample count?

**Answer:**

I'll query the MSK-CHORD study to find the most common cancer type based on sample count.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    attribute_value AS cancer_type,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) AS sample_count\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\nGROUP BY attribute_value\nORDER BY sample_count DESC\nLIMIT 10\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"cancer_type":"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","sample_count":7809},{"cancer_type":"Colorectal Cancer","sample_count":5543},{"cancer_type":"Breast Cancer","sample_count":5368},{"cancer_type":"Prostate Cancer","sample_count":3211},{"cancer_type":"Pancreatic Cancer","sample_count":3109}]}
```


Based on the MSK-CHORD study data, **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** is the most common cancer type with **7,809 samples**.

Here are the top 5 most common cancer types by sample count:

1. **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** - 7,809 samples
2. **Colorectal Cancer** - 5,543 samples
3. **Breast Cancer** - 5,368 samples
4. **Prostate Cancer** - 3,211 samples
5. **Pancreatic Cancer** - 3,109 samples

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer represents a significant portion of the study, which makes sense given that the MSK-CHORD study focuses on patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and lung cancer is one of the primary cancer types where these therapies are commonly used.
