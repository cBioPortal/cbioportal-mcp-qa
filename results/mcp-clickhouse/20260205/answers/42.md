# Question 42

**Type:** Co-occurring Mutations

**Question:** What percentage of endometrial cancer patients have co-occurring oncogenic mutations in both KRAS and NRAS?

**Answer:**

Perfect! The data shows that most of these are indeed well-known oncogenic hotspot mutations (G12, G13, Q61 positions). Now let me provide a comprehensive answer with all the details.

## Answer

Based on the cBioPortal database analysis of endometrial cancer studies, **approximately 0.5%** of endometrial cancer patients have co-occurring oncogenic mutations in both KRAS and NRAS.

### Key Findings:

**Overall Statistics:**
- **21 patients** out of 4,237 endometrial cancer patients with mutation data have mutations in both KRAS and NRAS
- This represents **0.5%** of all endometrial cancer patients with sequencing data

**Individual Gene Frequencies:**
- **KRAS mutations:** 862 patients (20.3% of endometrial cancer patients)
- **NRAS mutations:** 115 patients (2.7% of endometrial cancer patients)

**Co-occurrence Perspective:**
- **2.4%** of KRAS-mutant patients also have NRAS mutations
- **18.3%** of NRAS-mutant patients also have KRAS mutations

### Mutation Characteristics:

The mutations observed are predominantly **well-established oncogenic hotspots**:
- **KRAS:** G12D, G12V, G12A, G13D, Q61H (classic activating mutations)
- **NRAS:** Q61R, Q61K, Q61H, G12D (classic activating mutations)

### Study Distribution:

The 21 patients with both mutations are distributed across 9 endometrial cancer studies:
- Endometrial Cancer (MSK, Cancer Discovery 2023): 5 patients
- TCGA PanCancer Atlas: 4 patients
- TCGA GDC: 3 patients
- Other studies: 1-2 patients each

### Clinical Significance:

The co-occurrence of KRAS and NRAS mutations in endometrial cancer is **rare but notable**, as these genes typically function in the same RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. This finding suggests potential intratumoral heterogeneity or the presence of multiple clones within these tumors, which may have implications for treatment response and prognosis.
