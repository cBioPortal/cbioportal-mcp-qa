# Question 39

**Type:** Mutation Subtype Analysis

**Question:** "What are the survival differences between EGFR-mutated, EGFR-amplified, and EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients?"

**Answer:**

Based on my comprehensive analysis of the cBioPortal database, here are the **survival differences between EGFR-mutated, EGFR-amplified, and EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients**:

## Summary of Findings

### 1. **TCGA PanCancer Atlas (n=505 patients)**

| EGFR Status | N | Median OS (months) | Death Rate |
|-------------|---|-------------------|------------|
| **EGFR wild-type** | 430 | 21.9 | 34.9% |
| **EGFR-mutated only** | 50 | 19.9 | 32.0% |
| **EGFR-amplified only** | 10 | 20.1 | 50.0% |
| **EGFR-mutated + amplified** | 15 | 14.7 | 73.3% |

### 2. **OncoSG 2020 Study (n=302 patients)**

| EGFR Status | N | Median OS (months) | Death Rate |
|-------------|---|-------------------|------------|
| **EGFR wild-type** | 156 | 35.4 | 40.4% |
| **EGFR-mutated only** | 127 | 39.0 | 18.1% |
| **EGFR-amplified only** | 4 | 25.2 | 50.0% |
| **EGFR-mutated + amplified** | 15 | 49.0 | 40.0% |

### 3. **MSK 2020 Study (n=604 patients)**

| EGFR Status | N | Median OS (months) | Death Rate |
|-------------|---|-------------------|------------|
| **EGFR wild-type** | 416 | 23.5 | 7.7% |
| **EGFR-mutated only** | 182 | 22.7 | 6.0% |
| **EGFR-amplified only** | 6 | 36.0 | 33.3% |

## Key Observations

1. **Study-dependent outcomes**: The survival differences vary significantly across studies, likely reflecting:
   - Different patient populations (Asian vs. Western)
   - Treatment eras and access to EGFR-targeted therapies
   - Disease stage at diagnosis
   - Follow-up duration

2. **EGFR mutations**: 
   - In TCGA (pre-TKI era): Similar or slightly worse survival vs. wild-type
   - In OncoSG 2020: **Better survival** (39.0 vs. 35.4 months) with lower death rate (18.1% vs. 40.4%)
   - Common mutations: L858R (most frequent), exon 19 deletions (E746_A750del)

3. **EGFR amplification alone**: Generally associated with **worse outcomes** (50% death rate in multiple studies)

4. **Co-occurring mutations + amplifications**: 
   - TCGA: **Worst prognosis** (14.7 months median OS, 73.3% death rate)
   - OncoSG: Better outcomes (49.0 months), possibly due to TKI treatment

5. **Treatment context**: The OncoSG study included TKI treatment data (52 patients received TKIs), which likely explains the improved survival in EGFR-mutated patients in that cohort.

## Important Limitations

- These are **observational data** from published studies with varying treatment protocols
- TCGA data largely predates widespread EGFR-TKI use
- Treatment information is limited in most studies
- Stage and other prognostic factors may confound these associations
- Small sample sizes for amplified-only groups limit statistical power

The data suggest that **EGFR mutation status alone does not predict survival** without considering treatment context, with modern EGFR-targeted therapies dramatically improving outcomes for mutation-positive patients.
