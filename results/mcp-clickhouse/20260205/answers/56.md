# Question 56

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a summary:

## What cBioPortal Data Shows About MGMT Methylation in Glioblastoma

I found **MGMT promoter methylation status** recorded in several glioblastoma studies in cBioPortal. Here's what the actual data shows:

### **Available Data**

**Studies with MGMT methylation data:**
- **gbm_tcga_pub2013** (Glioblastoma, TCGA Cell 2013): 350 patients with MGMT status
- **lgggbm_tcga_pub** (Merged LGG/GBM, TCGA Cell 2016): 932 patients with MGMT promoter status

### **Key Findings from the Data**

#### **1. GBM Study (TCGA Cell 2013) - 348 patients with survival data:**

| MGMT Status | Patients | Avg Survival (months) | Deceased | Living |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|----------|--------|
| **Methylated** | 169 | **16.0 months** | 115 (68%) | 54 (32%) |
| **Unmethylated** | 179 | **11.9 months** | 131 (73%) | 48 (27%) |

**Observation:** Methylated MGMT patients survived ~4 months longer on average.

#### **2. Merged LGG/GBM Study (TCGA Cell 2016) - 861 patients:**

| MGMT Status | Patients | Avg Survival (months) | Deceased | Living |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|----------|--------|
| **Methylated** | 560 | **21.9 months** | 175 (31%) | 385 (69%) |
| **Unmethylated** | 301 | **14.9 months** | 178 (59%) | 123 (41%) |

**Observation:** Methylated MGMT patients survived ~7 months longer and had better survival rates.

#### **3. Treatment Response Data (GBM TCGA 2013):**

Comparing survival by MGMT status and treatment type:

| Treatment | MGMT Status | Patients | Avg Survival |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Standard Radiation + TMZ Chemo** | Methylated | 30 | **27.2 months** |
| **Standard Radiation + TMZ Chemo** | Unmethylated | 30 | **14.3 months** |
| **TMZ Chemoradiation + TMZ Chemo** | Methylated | 83 | **15.2 months** |
| **TMZ Chemoradiation + TMZ Chemo** | Unmethylated | 80 | **11.6 months** |
| **Standard Radiation only** | Methylated | 8 | **18.9 months** |
| **Standard Radiation only** | Unmethylated | 16 | **10.7 months** |

**Observation:** The survival benefit of MGMT methylation appears most pronounced in patients receiving TMZ chemotherapy (nearly **2x survival** in the Standard Radiation + TMZ group).

### **What This Data Represents**

This is **observational clinical data** from published cancer genomics studies. It shows:
- ✅ MGMT methylation status was recorded for these patients
- ✅ Survival outcomes and treatment regimens are documented
- ✅ Associations between MGMT status, treatment, and survival can be observed

### **What This Data Does NOT Tell You**

- ❌ Causation (correlation ≠ causation)
- ❌ Treatment recommendations for individual patients
- ❌ Biological mechanisms of MGMT methylation
- ❌ Whether specific patients should receive certain treatments

For questions about the biological mechanisms, clinical guidelines, or treatment decisions, you would need to consult medical literature and clinical experts, not genomics databases.
