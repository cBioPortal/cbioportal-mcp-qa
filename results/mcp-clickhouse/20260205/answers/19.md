# Question 19

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 10 most frequently mutated genes across all cancer types in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 10 most frequently mutated genes across all cancer types in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the genomic data.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as num_samples_mutated,\n    COUNT(*) as total_mutations\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol != ''\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY num_samples_mutated DESC\nLIMIT 10\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TP53","num_samples_mutated":13124,"total_mutations":13876},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"KRAS","num_samples_mutated":7128,"total_mutations":7231},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"APC","num_samples_mutated":4777,"total_mutations":7187},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"PIK3CA","num_samples_mutated":3708,"total_mutations":4178},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"EGFR","num_samples_mutated":2159,"total_mutations":2556},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"ARID1A","num_samples_mutated":1843,"total_mutations":2205},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"SMAD4","num_samples_mutated":1796,"total_mutations":1925},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"KMT2D","num_samples_mutated":1783,"total_mutations":2390},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"KMT2C","num_samples_mutated":1629,"total_mutations":1979},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"ATM","num_samples_mutated":1388,"total_mutations":1681}]}
```


Perfect! Here are the **top 10 most frequently mutated genes** across all cancer types in the MSK-CHORD study:

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Samples with Mutation | Total Mutations |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 13,124 | 13,876 |
| 2 | **KRAS** | 7,128 | 7,231 |
| 3 | **APC** | 4,777 | 7,187 |
| 4 | **PIK3CA** | 3,708 | 4,178 |
| 5 | **EGFR** | 2,159 | 2,556 |
| 6 | **ARID1A** | 1,843 | 2,205 |
| 7 | **SMAD4** | 1,796 | 1,925 |
| 8 | **KMT2D** | 1,783 | 2,390 |
| 9 | **KMT2C** | 1,629 | 1,979 |
| 10 | **ATM** | 1,388 | 1,681 |

**Key Findings:**

- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in over 13,000 samples
- **KRAS** is the second most common, present in over 7,000 samples
- **APC** shows a notable pattern with 4,777 samples having mutations but 7,187 total mutations, indicating some samples have multiple APC mutations
- The list includes well-known cancer driver genes involved in:
  - Cell cycle regulation (TP53)
  - Signal transduction (KRAS, PIK3CA, EGFR)
  - Tumor suppression (APC, SMAD4)
  - Chromatin modification (ARID1A, KMT2D, KMT2C)
  - DNA damage response (ATM)
