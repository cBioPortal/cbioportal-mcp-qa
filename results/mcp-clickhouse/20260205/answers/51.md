# Question 51

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the fraction of patients older than 5 at diagnosis in the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET. Let me start by searching for this study.



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "neuroblastoma TARGET"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```


Let me try a broader search:



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "neuroblastoma"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```




Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "TARGET"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json
[{"cancer_study_identifier":"aml_target_gdc","name":"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"aml","sample_count":2767,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"all_phase2_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Acute Lymphoid Leukemia - Phase II (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"bll","sample_count":1979,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"nbl_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"nbl","sample_count":1090,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"aml_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"aml","sample_count":1026,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"bll_target_gdc","name":"B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"bll","sample_count":990,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"wt_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Wilms' Tumor (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"wt","sample_count":658,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"nbl_target_gdc","name":"Neuroblastoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"nbl","sample_count":534,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"alal_target_gdc","name":"Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"alal","sample_count":252,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"os_target_gdc","name":"Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"os","sample_count":160,"has_guide":true},{"cancer_study_identifier":"wt_target_gdc","name":"Wilms' Tumor (TARGET GDC, 2025)","type_of_cancer_id":"wt","sample_count":133,"has_guide":false},{"cancer_study_identifier":"rt_target_2018_pub","name":"Pediatric Rhabdoid Tumor (TARGET, 2018)","type_of_cancer_id":"mrt","sample_count":73,"has_guide":false}]
```


Great! I found the study: "Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)" with identifier `nbl_target_2018_pub`. Now let me query for the age at diagnosis data.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as total_patients,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN toFloat64OrNull(attribute_value) > 5 THEN patient_unique_id END) as patients_older_than_5,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN toFloat64OrNull(attribute_value) > 5 THEN patient_unique_id END) / COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as fraction_older_than_5\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'nbl_target_2018_pub'\n  AND attribute_name = 'AGE'\n  AND attribute_value IS NOT NULL\n  AND attribute_value != ''\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_patients":1076,"patients_older_than_5":125,"fraction_older_than_5":0.11617100371747212}]}
```


Based on the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET (2018), I found that:

- **Total patients with age data**: 1,076
- **Patients older than 5 at diagnosis**: 125
- **Fraction older than 5**: **0.116** or approximately **11.6%**

This means that about **1 in 9** patients (or roughly 12%) in this pediatric neuroblastoma cohort were older than 5 years at the time of diagnosis. The vast majority (about 88%) were 5 years old or younger, which is consistent with neuroblastoma being primarily a disease of early childhood.
