# Question 51

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about the age distribution in the TARGET Pediatric Neuroblastoma study.

## Answer

Based on the **Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)** study:

**Fraction of patients older than 5 at diagnosis: 125/1,076 = 0.116 or approximately 11.6%**

### Additional Context:
- **Total patients with age data:** 1,076
- **Patients ≤ 5 years old:** 951 (88.4%)
- **Patients > 5 years old:** 125 (11.6%)
- **Age range:** 0 to 21 years
- **Median age at diagnosis:** 3 years
- **Mean age at diagnosis:** 3.4 years

This distribution is consistent with neuroblastoma being predominantly a disease of early childhood, with the vast majority of patients diagnosed before age 5.
