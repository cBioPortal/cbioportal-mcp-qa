### Top 10 Treatment Agents:

1. **FLUOROURACIL** - 6,319 patients (26.3%)
2. **LEUCOVORIN** - 5,573 patients (23.2%)
3. **OXALIPLATIN** - 5,489 patients (22.8%)
4. **CAPECITABINE** - 4,808 patients (20.0%)
5. **CARBOPLATIN** - 4,604 patients (19.2%)
6. **IRINOTECAN** - 4,329 patients (18.0%)

### Key Findings:

- **Most common treatment**: **Fluorouracil** (5-FU), received by over 6,300 patients (26.3%)
- The top three treatments (Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin) are often used together in the **FOLFOX regimen**, a common chemotherapy combination for colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers
- Out of 24,950 total patients in the study, 24,028 (96.3%) have treatment data recorded
- The study includes diverse treatment types: chemotherapy (most common), hormone therapy (e.g., Leuprolide, Letrozole), targeted therapy (e.g., Bevacizumab), and immunotherapy (e.g., Pembrolizumab)

The prevalence of colorectal cancer chemotherapy agents reflects the diverse cancer types included in this large pan-cancer study.
