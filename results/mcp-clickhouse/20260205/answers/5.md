# Question 5

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

## Answer

Based on the MSK-CHORD study data, here are the most common treatments received by patients:

**Top 10 Treatment Agents:**

1. **Fluorouracil (5-FU)** - 6,319 patients (29.4%)
2. **Leucovorin** - 5,573 patients (26.0%)
3. **Oxaliplatin** - 5,489 patients (25.6%)
4. **Capecitabine** - 4,808 patients (22.4%)
5. **Carboplatin** - 4,604 patients (21.4%)
6. **Irinotecan** - 4,329 patients (20.2%)
7. **Gemcitabine** - 4,038 patients (18.8%)
8. **Leuprolide** - 3,708 patients (17.3%)
9. **Paclitaxel** - 3,679 patients (17.1%)
10. **Pemetrexed** - 3,357 patients (15.6%)

**Key Findings:**

- The study includes 24,950 total patients, with treatment data available for 21,473 patients
- **Fluorouracil** was the most commonly administered treatment, received by nearly 30% of patients with treatment records
- The top three treatments (Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin) are commonly used together in the **FOLFOX regimen**, a standard chemotherapy combination for colorectal cancer
- The treatment data reflects a diverse range of cancer types, including chemotherapy agents (19,551 patients), radiation therapy (12,318 patients), hormone therapy (8,379 patients), targeted therapy (5,377 patients), and immunotherapy (3,341 patients)

This pattern is consistent with MSK-CHORD being a large pan-cancer study that includes many gastrointestinal cancers where FOLFOX-based regimens are standard of care.
