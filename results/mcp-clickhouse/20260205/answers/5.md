# Question 5

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most common treatment received by patients in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the clinical events data for treatment information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    value AS treatment,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) AS patient_count\nFROM clinical_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND key = 'AGENT'\nGROUP BY value\nORDER BY patient_count DESC\nLIMIT 20\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"treatment":"FLUOROURACIL","patient_count":6319},{"treatment":"LEUCOVORIN","patient_count":5573},{"treatment":"OXALIPLATIN","patient_count":5489},{"treatment":"CAPECITABINE","patient_count":4808},{"treatment":"CARBOPLATIN","patient_count":4604},{"treatment":"IRINOTECAN","patient_count":4329},{"treatment":"INVESTIGATIONAL","patient_count":4114},{"treatment":"GEMCITABINE","patient_count":4038},{"treatment":"LEUPROLIDE","patient_count":3708},{"treatment":"PACLITAXEL","patient_count":3679},{"treatment":"PEMETREXED","patient_count":3357},{"treatment":"BEVACIZUMAB","patient_count":2629},{"treatment":"CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE","patient_count":2494},{"treatment":"PACLITAXEL PROTEIN-BOUND","patient_count":2357},{"treatment":"LETROZOLE","patient_count":2260},{"treatment":"DOXORUBICIN","patient_count":2107},{"treatment":"ZOLEDRONIC ACID","patient_count":2101},{"treatment":"PEMBROLIZUMAB","patient_count":2061},{"treatment":"DOCETAXEL","patient_count":1917},{"treatment":"ANASTROZOLE","patient_count":1676}]}
```


Based on the MSK-CHORD study data, **FLUOROURACIL** was the most commonly received treatment, administered to **6,319 patients**.

The top 5 most common treatments were:

1. **FLUOROURACIL** - 6,319 patients
2. **LEUCOVORIN** - 5,573 patients
3. **OXALIPLATIN** - 5,489 patients
4. **CAPECITABINE** - 4,808 patients
5. **CARBOPLATIN** - 4,604 patients

It's worth noting that many of these top treatments are often used in combination chemotherapy regimens. For example, FLUOROURACIL, LEUCOVORIN, and OXALIPLATIN are commonly combined in the FOLFOX regimen, which is frequently used to treat colorectal cancer. This makes sense given that the MSK-CHORD study includes a significant number of gastrointestinal cancer patients.
