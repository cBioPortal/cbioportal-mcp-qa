# Question 36

**Type:** Methylation Expression Analysis

**Question:** Is BRCA1 promoter methylation associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data to answer the question. Let me compile the findings:

## Answer: Yes, BRCA1 promoter methylation is associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer

Based on analysis of cBioPortal data from TCGA ovarian cancer studies, there is **strong evidence** that BRCA1 promoter methylation is inversely associated with BRCA1 mRNA expression:

### Key Findings:

#### **1. TCGA Ovarian Cancer (Firehose Legacy) - ov_tcga**
- **Sample size:** 298 samples with paired methylation and RNA-seq data
- **Correlation coefficient:** -0.418 (moderate negative correlation, p < 0.001)
- **Average methylation:** 0.120 (β-value)
- **Average expression:** 236.7 RSEM

**Methylation stratification:**
| Methylation Level | N | Avg Methylation | Avg Expression | Median Expression |
|-------------------|---|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Low (<0.1)** | 250 | 0.034 | **267.1 RSEM** | 240.3 |
| **Medium (0.1-0.3)** | 13 | 0.163 | **183.8 RSEM** | 154.9 |
| **High (≥0.3)** | 35 | 0.720 | **39.2 RSEM** | 21.6 |

**Key observation:** Samples with high BRCA1 promoter methylation (≥0.3) showed **6.8-fold lower** average expression compared to low methylation samples (39.2 vs 267.1 RSEM).

#### **2. TCGA Ovarian Cancer (Nature 2011) - ov_tcga_pub**
- **Sample size:** 489 samples with paired methylation and microarray expression data
- **Correlation coefficient:** -0.609 (strong negative correlation, p < 0.001)
- **Average methylation:** 0.131 (β-value)

**Methylation stratification:**
| Methylation Level | N | Avg Methylation | Avg Expression (log2) |
|-------------------|---|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Low (<0.1)** | 311 | 0.050 | **+0.155** |
| **Medium (0.1-0.3)** | 122 | 0.169 | **+0.054** |
| **High (≥0.3)** | 56 | 0.501 | **-1.008** |

### Examples of Hypermethylated Samples:
Samples with very high methylation (>0.85) showed dramatically reduced expression:
- TCGA-59-2363: methylation = 0.930, expression = 10.3 RSEM
- TCGA-24-1428: methylation = 0.926, expression = 38.3 RSEM
- TCGA-10-0928: methylation = 0.915, expression = 9.2 RSEM

### Biological Interpretation:
These findings are consistent with the established mechanism of **epigenetic silencing** where:
1. DNA methylation at CpG islands in the BRCA1 promoter region blocks transcription factor binding
2. This leads to transcriptional repression and reduced mRNA expression
3. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation is a known mechanism of BRCA1 inactivation in ovarian cancer, occurring in approximately 10-15% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers

### Statistical Significance:
Both datasets show statistically significant negative correlations (correlation coefficients of -0.42 and -0.61), indicating that **increased BRCA1 promoter methylation is robustly associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression** in ovarian cancer.
