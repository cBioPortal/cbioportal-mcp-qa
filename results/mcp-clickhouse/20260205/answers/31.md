# Question 31

**Type:** Cross-Cancer Mutation Frequency

**Question:** Which cancer types have the highest frequency of EGFR mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the top cancer types with the highest EGFR mutation frequencies:

## EGFR Mutation Frequencies Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas Studies

Based on the analysis of 32 TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, here are the **cancer types with the highest frequency of EGFR mutations**:

### Top 10 Cancer Types by EGFR Mutation Frequency:

1. **Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)** - **21.12%**
   - 94 out of 445 samples with EGFR mutations
   - By far the highest frequency among all cancer types

2. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** - **12.37%**
   - 70 out of 566 samples with EGFR mutations
   - Second highest, consistent with known EGFR driver mutations in lung cancer

3. **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM)** - **7.81%**
   - 35 out of 448 samples with EGFR mutations

4. **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)** - **6.92%**
   - 36 out of 520 samples with EGFR mutations

5. **Brain Lower Grade Glioma (LGG)** - **6.81%**
   - 35 out of 514 samples with EGFR mutations
   - Similar to GBM, reflecting EGFR's role in gliomas

6. **Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD)** - **4.77%**
   - 21 out of 440 samples with EGFR mutations

7. **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)** - **2.89%**
   - 14 out of 484 samples with EGFR mutations

8. **Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (ESCA)** - **2.75%**
   - 5 out of 182 samples with EGFR mutations

9. **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD)** - **2.53%**
   - 15 out of 592 samples with EGFR mutations

10. **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC)** - **2.51%**
    - 13 out of 517 samples with EGFR mutations

### Key Findings:

- **Glioblastoma** shows the highest EGFR mutation frequency at over 21%, nearly double that of lung adenocarcinoma
- **Brain tumors** (GBM and LGG) and **lung cancers** (LUAD and LUSC) are the primary cancer types where EGFR mutations are prevalent
- Several cancer types showed **no EGFR mutations**, including thyroid carcinoma, thymoma, uveal melanoma, and several others
- The mutation frequencies align with known biology, where EGFR is a well-established oncogenic driver in glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma
