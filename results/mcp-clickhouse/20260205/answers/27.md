# Question 27

**Type:** Expression Analysis

**Question:** Is there a correlation between ERBB2 gene amplification and ERBB2 protein expression levels in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now let me create a comprehensive summary:

## Analysis Results: ERBB2 Gene Amplification vs HER2 Protein Expression in MSK-CHORD Breast Cancer Samples

**Yes, there is a strong positive correlation between ERBB2 gene amplification and HER2 protein expression levels in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD study.**

### Key Findings:

**Total breast cancer samples analyzed:** 5,392 samples with both ERBB2 CNA and HER2 protein status data

### 1. **ERBB2 Amplification Status and HER2 Protein Expression:**

| CNA Status | HER2 Negative | HER2 Positive | Total | % HER2 Positive |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Amplification (2)** | 88 | 587 | 675 | **86.96%** |
| **Neutral (0)** | 4,435 | 281 | 4,716 | **5.96%** |
| **Homozygous Deletion (-2)** | 1 | 0 | 1 | **0%** |

### 2. **HER2 Protein Status and ERBB2 Amplification:**

| HER2 Protein Status | Total Samples | Amplified | Neutral | % Amplified |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **HER2 Positive** | 868 | 587 | 281 | **67.63%** |
| **HER2 Negative** | 4,524 | 88 | 4,435 | **1.95%** |

### 3. **Correlation Strength:**

- **Samples with ERBB2 amplification:** 86.96% are HER2 protein positive
- **Samples without ERBB2 amplification (neutral):** Only 5.96% are HER2 protein positive
- **HER2 positive samples:** 67.63% have ERBB2 amplification
- **HER2 negative samples:** Only 1.95% have ERBB2 amplification

### Clinical Interpretation:

1. **Strong concordance:** ERBB2 gene amplification is highly predictive of HER2 protein overexpression (87% positive predictive value)

2. **Discordant cases exist:**
   - **281 samples (32.4% of HER2+ cases)** are HER2 protein positive without ERBB2 amplification, suggesting alternative mechanisms of HER2 overexpression
   - **88 samples (13% of amplified cases)** have ERBB2 amplification but are HER2 protein negative, possibly due to post-transcriptional regulation or technical factors

3. **Clinical relevance:** This strong correlation supports the use of ERBB2 amplification status as a biomarker for HER2-targeted therapy eligibility in breast cancer, though protein expression testing remains important for identifying discordant cases.
