**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have the complete answer. Let me provide a comprehensive response:

## Median Age at Diagnosis for Osteosarcoma Patients in TARGET Study

Based on the **TARGET Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)** study (`os_target_gdc`), the **median age at diagnosis is 15.2 years**.

### Additional Statistics:
- **Total patients with age data**: 293
- **Mean age**: 16.2 years
- **Age range**: 3.6 to 87.1 years
- **First quartile (Q1)**: 12.2 years
- **Third quartile (Q3)**: 17.7 years

### Context:
The median age of 15.2 years is consistent with the known epidemiology of osteosarcoma, which predominantly affects children and adolescents, with peak incidence during the adolescent growth spurt. The interquartile range (12.2-17.7 years) shows that the majority of patients in this study were diagnosed during their teenage years, though the range extends from young children to elderly adults.
