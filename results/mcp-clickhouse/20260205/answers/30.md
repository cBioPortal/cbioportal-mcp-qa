# Question 30

**Type:** Copy Number Expression Correlation

**Question:** Is CDK4 mRNA expression significantly higher in samples with CDK4 amplification compared to diploid samples?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now let me provide a comprehensive answer with all the statistical evidence.

## Answer

**Yes, CDK4 mRNA expression is significantly higher in samples with CDK4 amplification compared to diploid samples.**

### Statistical Evidence

Based on analysis of **19,315 samples** across multiple cancer studies in cBioPortal:

#### **Overall Results:**

| CNA Status | N Samples | Mean Expression | Median Expression | Std Dev | Q25 | Q75 |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|-----|-----|
| **Amplified (CNA=2)** | 691 | 13,444.88 | 1,168.42 | 33,194.98 | 138.83 | 8,286.0 |
| **Diploid (CNA=0)** | 18,624 | 1,040.62 | 76.27 | 1,737.39 | 29.58 | 1,752.0 |

#### **Effect Size:**
- **Fold Change (Mean):** 12.92×
- **Fold Change (Median):** 15.32×
- **Cohen's d:** 1.91 (very large effect size)
- **Median Increase:** 1,432% higher in amplified samples

### Interpretation

1. **Magnitude:** CDK4 amplification is associated with approximately **13-fold higher mean expression** and **15-fold higher median expression** compared to diploid samples.

2. **Statistical Significance:** The Cohen's d of 1.91 indicates a **very large effect size** (conventionally, d > 0.8 is considered large). This suggests the difference is not only statistically significant but also highly biologically meaningful.

3. **Consistency Across Cancer Types:** The pattern holds across multiple cancer types, with particularly strong effects observed in:
   - **Glioblastoma (GBM):** Amplified mean = 32,875 vs Diploid mean = 1,793 (18.3× fold change)
   - **Brain tumors:** Amplified mean = 14,850 vs Diploid mean = 405 (36.7× fold change)
   - **Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC):** Amplified mean = 17,308 vs Diploid mean = 2,027 (8.5× fold change)

4. **Biological Relevance:** This strong correlation between CDK4 copy number amplification and mRNA expression demonstrates that CDK4 amplification is a functional genomic alteration that leads to increased gene expression, which is consistent with its role as an oncogene in cancer.

### Conclusion

The data provides robust evidence that **CDK4 amplification drives significantly elevated mRNA expression**, with both statistical and biological significance across diverse cancer types.
