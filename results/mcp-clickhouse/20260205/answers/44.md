# Question 44

**Type:** Hypermutation Phenotype

**Question:** What percentage of endometrial cancer samples have hypermutation (>5000 mutations) and how does this correlate with histological subtype?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me create a summary analysis:

## Analysis Results

Based on the cBioPortal endometrial cancer data, here are the key findings regarding hypermutation (>5000 mutations) and its correlation with histological subtype:

### Overall Hypermutation Rate

Analyzing **610 endometrial cancer samples** from TCGA PanCancer Atlas (515 samples) and CPTAC (95 samples) studies with whole exome sequencing data:

- **Total samples with hypermutation (>5000 mutations): 41 samples (6.72%)**
- **Average mutation count: 968.61 mutations**
- **Median mutation count: 71.5 mutations**
- **Range: 4 to 25,698 mutations**

### Correlation with Molecular Subtype (CPTAC Study, n=95)

The strongest correlation is with **molecular subtype** rather than histological subtype:

| Molecular Subtype | Total Samples | Hypermutated (>5000) | Hypermutation Rate | Avg Mutations | Median Mutations |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **POLE** | 7 | 3 | **42.86%** | 4,561 | 3,279 |
| **MSI-H** | 25 | 0 | 0% | 669 | 523 |
| **CNV_low** | 43 | 0 | 0% | 55 | 41 |
| **CNV_high** | 20 | 0 | 0% | 43 | 40 |

### Correlation with Histological Subtype (CPTAC Study, n=95)

| Histologic Type | Total Samples | Hypermutated (>5000) | Hypermutation Rate | Avg Mutations | Median Mutations |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Endometrioid** | 83 | 3 | **3.61%** | 618 | 59 |
| **Serous** | 12 | 0 | 0% | 49 | 45 |

### Detailed Histologic Type × Molecular Subtype Analysis

| Histologic Type | Molecular Subtype | Samples | Hypermutated | Rate | Avg Mutations |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------|--------------|------|---------------|
| Endometrioid | POLE | 7 | 3 | **42.86%** | 4,561 |
| Endometrioid | MSI-H | 25 | 0 | 0% | 669 |
| Endometrioid | CNV_low | 43 | 0 | 0% | 55 |
| Endometrioid | CNV_high | 8 | 0 | 0% | 35 |
| Serous | CNV_high | 12 | 0 | 0% | 49 |

### Additional Insights from MSK Study (n=1,866, targeted sequencing)

While the MSK study uses targeted sequencing (lower mutation counts), it shows histologic grade patterns:

| Histology | Samples | High Mutation (>10) | Avg Mutations |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| Endometrioid G3 | 199 | 52.26% | 14.58 |
| Undifferentiated | 33 | 57.58% | 13.27 |
| Endometrioid G1/2 | 812 | 31.16% | 9.64 |
| Serous | 281 | 0.71% | 3.14 |

### Key Conclusions

1. **~6.7% of endometrial cancers show hypermutation (>5000 mutations)** in whole exome sequencing studies

2. **POLE-mutant tumors have the highest hypermutation rate (42.86%)**, with nearly half showing >5000 mutations

3. **Endometrioid histology is more likely to be hypermutated (3.61%)** compared to serous carcinoma (0%)

4. **All hypermutated cases in this dataset were endometrioid histology with POLE mutations**

5. **MSI-H tumors show elevated mutation burden (median 523)** but typically don't reach the >5000 threshold for hypermutation

6. **Higher histologic grade (G3) correlates with higher mutation burden** even in targeted sequencing
