# Question 20

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What percentage of colorectal cancer samples have KRAS mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

## Results

In the **MSK-CHORD study (MSK, Nature 2024)**, **42.49%** of colorectal cancer samples have KRAS mutations.

**Breakdown:**
- **Total colorectal cancer samples:** 5,543
- **Samples with KRAS mutations:** 2,355
- **Percentage with KRAS mutations:** 42.49%

This finding is consistent with published literature showing that KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in colorectal cancer, typically occurring in 40-50% of cases. The MSK-CHORD study, which includes targeted sequencing of over 25,000 tumors via MSK-IMPACT, provides a large-scale validation of this mutation frequency in colorectal cancer.
