# Question 20

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What percentage of colorectal cancer samples have KRAS mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the percentage of colorectal cancer samples with KRAS mutations in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the database.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH colorectal_samples AS (\n  SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n  FROM clinical_data_derived\n  WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n    AND attribute_value = 'Colorectal Cancer'\n),\nkras_mutated_samples AS (\n  SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n  FROM genomic_event_derived\n  WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'KRAS'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND sample_unique_id IN (SELECT sample_unique_id FROM colorectal_samples)\n)\nSELECT \n  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM colorectal_samples) AS total_colorectal_samples,\n  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kras_mutated_samples) AS kras_mutated_samples,\n  ROUND((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kras_mutated_samples) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM colorectal_samples), 2) AS percentage_with_kras_mutation\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_colorectal_samples":5543,"kras_mutated_samples":2355,"percentage_with_kras_mutation":42.49}]}
```


Based on the MSK-CHORD study data:

**42.49%** of colorectal cancer samples have KRAS mutations.

Specifically:
- **Total colorectal cancer samples**: 5,543
- **Samples with KRAS mutations**: 2,355
- **Percentage**: 42.49%

This finding is consistent with known literature showing that KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal cancer, typically occurring in 40-50% of cases.
