# Question 67

**Type:** Genomic Alteration–Subtype Association

**Question:** In the TCGA Breast Cancer study if a patient has both a PIK3CA mutation and a PTEN deletion what is their probability of having a luminal A subtype? Is this probability different from a patient with only a PIK3CA mutation?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TCGA Breast Cancer (Nature 2012) study, I can now answer your question:

## Key Findings:

### PIK3CA mutation + PTEN mutation (not deletion):
- **Total samples**: 5 patients
- **Luminal A subtype**: 3 patients (60.0%)
- **Luminal B subtype**: 2 patients (40.0%)

### PIK3CA mutation only (no PTEN alteration):
- **Total samples**: 173 patients  
- **Luminal A subtype**: 101 patients (58.38%)
- **Other subtypes**: 
  - Luminal B: 37 (21.4%)
  - HER2-enriched: 23 (13.3%)
  - Basal-like: 8 (4.6%)
  - Normal-like: 4 (2.3%)

## Answer to Your Question:

**The probability of having luminal A subtype is essentially the same** between the two groups:
- **PIK3CA mutation + PTEN alteration**: 60.0% (3/5 patients)
- **PIK3CA mutation only**: 58.38% (101/173 patients)

The difference is only 1.62 percentage points, which is not statistically meaningful, especially given the very small sample size (n=5) in the combined alteration group.

## Important Notes:

1. **No PTEN deep deletions with PIK3CA mutations**: Interestingly, there were **zero samples** with both PIK3CA mutation and PTEN deep deletion (-2). The 5 samples with both alterations had PIK3CA mutations and PTEN **mutations** (not deletions).

2. **Small sample size**: The group with both alterations is very small (n=5), so the probability estimate has wide confidence intervals and should be interpreted cautiously.

3. **PIK3CA mutations are enriched in luminal subtypes**: Both groups show a strong association with luminal A subtype (~60%), which is consistent with known biology where PIK3CA mutations are particularly common in hormone receptor-positive breast cancers.
