# Question 61

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Clinical attributes

**Question:** In the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients who were older than four when diagnosed and the younger ones?

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now I have all the data needed to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me calculate the chi-square statistic and p-value manually:

Based on the data from the **Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018)** study, here are the survival differences between patients diagnosed at age 4 or younger versus those older than 4:

## **Survival Statistics Summary**

### **Patients Age 4 or Younger (n=822)**
- **Deceased:** 276 patients (33.58%)
- **Living:** 546 patients (66.42%)
- **Mean survival:** 58.21 months
- **Median survival:** 57.0 months
- **Survival range:** 1-183 months

### **Patients Older than Age 4 (n=250)**
- **Deceased:** 121 patients (48.40%)
- **Living:** 129 patients (51.60%)
- **Mean survival:** 55.88 months
- **Median survival:** 46.5 months
- **Survival range:** 1-183 months

## **Key Findings**

1. **Mortality Rate Difference:** Patients diagnosed after age 4 had a **14.82 percentage point higher mortality rate** (48.40% vs 33.58%)

2. **Survival Time Difference:** 
   - Mean survival was 2.33 months shorter in older patients
   - Median survival was **10.5 months shorter** in older patients (46.5 vs 57.0 months)

## **Statistical Significance**

Using a **chi-square test** for the mortality rates:
- **Chi-square statistic:** 17.96
- **P-value:** < 0.0001 (highly significant)

The difference in mortality rates between the two age groups is **statistically highly significant** (p < 0.0001), indicating that age at diagnosis is a strong prognostic factor in pediatric neuroblastoma. Patients diagnosed after age 4 have significantly worse survival outcomes compared to those diagnosed at age 4 or younger.

This finding is consistent with established clinical knowledge that older age at diagnosis is associated with more aggressive disease and poorer prognosis in neuroblastoma.
