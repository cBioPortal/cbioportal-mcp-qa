# Question 43

**Type:** Clonality Analysis

**Question:** "In samples with both KRAS and NRAS mutations, what is the distribution of variant allele frequencies suggesting clonal vs subclonal events?"

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive summary. Based on the analysis of samples with both KRAS and NRAS mutations, here are the key findings:

## Distribution of Variant Allele Frequencies in Samples with Both KRAS and NRAS Mutations

### Overall Summary
- **Total samples with both mutations**: 445 samples
- **Total mutations analyzed**: 945 (470 KRAS, 475 NRAS)
- **Mutations with VAF data**: 793 (84%)

### VAF Distribution Suggesting Clonal vs Subclonal Events

**Overall VAF Statistics:**
- Mean VAF: **20.4%**
- Median VAF: **15.8%**
- Range: 0% to 100%

**Clonality Classification:**

1. **Likely Clonal (VAF ≥ 40%)**: 110 mutations (13.9%)
   - These high VAF mutations suggest they are present in most tumor cells
   - Likely represent early, founder mutations

2. **Intermediate (VAF 25-40%)**: 139 mutations (17.5%)
   - May represent clonal mutations with lower tumor purity or copy number effects
   - Or major subclones

3. **Likely Subclonal (VAF < 25%)**: 542 mutations (68.3%)
   - These low VAF mutations suggest they arose later during tumor evolution
   - Present in only a subset of tumor cells
   - **This is the dominant pattern** in samples with both KRAS and NRAS mutations

### Gene-Specific Patterns

**KRAS mutations:**
- Mean VAF: 20.3%, Median: 15.6%
- Clonal (≥40%): 52 (13.2%)
- Subclonal (<25%): 260 (66.0%)

**NRAS mutations:**
- Mean VAF: 20.4%, Median: 15.9%
- Clonal (≥40%): 58 (14.5%)
- Subclonal (<25%): 282 (70.7%)

**Key Finding**: Both genes show remarkably similar VAF distributions, suggesting they often arise as competing subclonal events rather than one being consistently clonal and the other subclonal.

### Cancer Type Patterns

Studies with highest representation (≥3 samples):
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: 69 samples, avg VAF 12.6% - predominantly subclonal
- **MSK pan-cancer cohorts**: 40-45 samples, avg VAF 18-24% - mixed clonal/subclonal
- **Lung adenocarcinoma metastases**: 8 samples, avg VAF 35.4% - more clonal
- **Cell lines**: 7 samples, avg VAF 49.4% - highly clonal (expected in culture)

### Biological Interpretation

The **predominance of low VAF mutations (68%)** in samples with both KRAS and NRAS mutations strongly suggests:

1. **Subclonal competition**: KRAS and NRAS mutations typically arise as competing subclones rather than co-occurring in the same cells
2. **Tumor heterogeneity**: These tumors show significant intratumoral heterogeneity with multiple RAS-mutant subpopulations
3. **Evolutionary dynamics**: The co-occurrence likely represents convergent evolution where different tumor subclones independently acquired RAS pathway activation
4. **Clinical implications**: Low VAF suggests these may be minor subclones that could be missed by less sensitive sequencing methods

This pattern is particularly pronounced in hematologic malignancies (MDS, AML) where the median VAF is ~12-15%, consistent with these being minor subclones in a heterogeneous disease.
