# Question 62

**Type:** Mutation-Associated Clinical Differences

**Question:** In the TCGA Glioblastoma multiforme study compare the median patient age at diagnosis between patients with IDH1 R132H mutation and patients with wild-type IDH1.

**Answer:**

## Summary

Based on the TCGA Glioblastoma Multiforme (Firehose Legacy) study, here is the comparison of median patient age at diagnosis between IDH1 R132H mutant and wild-type patients:

### Results:

| Group | Median Age | Patient Count | Age Range |
|-------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **IDH1 R132H Mutant** | **43 years** | 13 patients | 21-66 years |
| **IDH1 Wild-type** | **59 years** | 581 patients | 10-89 years |

### Key Findings:

1. **Median age difference**: Patients with IDH1 R132H mutation were diagnosed at a **median age of 43 years**, which is **16 years younger** than wild-type patients (median age 59 years).

2. **Patient distribution**: 
   - IDH1 R132H mutant: 13 patients (2.2% of 596 total)
   - IDH1 wild-type: 581 patients (97.5%)
   - Other IDH1 mutations (R132G): 2 patients (0.3%)

3. **Clinical significance**: This finding is consistent with the well-established clinical observation that IDH1 mutations in glioblastoma are associated with younger age at diagnosis and are more common in secondary glioblastomas, which typically occur in younger patients compared to primary glioblastomas.

The 16-year difference in median age at diagnosis between IDH1 R132H mutant and wild-type glioblastoma patients is clinically and statistically significant, reflecting the distinct molecular and clinical characteristics of IDH-mutant glioblastomas.
