# Question 57

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?

**Answer:**

Based on my exploration of the cBioPortal database, I can provide you with information about what data is available regarding EML4-ALK fusion variants in lung cancer patients:

## Available Data in cBioPortal

I found **772 unique patients** with EML4-ALK fusions across multiple lung cancer studies in cBioPortal. The database contains:

### Fusion Variant Information:
- Multiple EML4-ALK fusion variants are documented with different exon breakpoints
- Common variants include:
  - EML4 exon 13 - ALK exon 20 fusions
  - EML4 exon 6 - ALK exon 20 fusions  
  - EML4 exon 2 - ALK exon 20 fusions
  - Various other in-frame and mid-exon fusions

### Clinical Outcome Data Available:
- **Overall Survival (OS)**: 586 patients have OS data (months and status)
- **Progression-Free Survival (PFS)**: Only 16 patients have PFS data
- **Treatment records**: 233-313 patients have treatment event data
- **Surgery records**: 313 patients

## Important Limitations

**However, cBioPortal does NOT contain data on:**

1. **Quality of life (QoL) measurements** - I found only 1 attribute related to "quality" (a tumor quality score for imaging), but no patient-reported quality of life outcomes
2. **Secondary cancer/subsequent malignancy data** - No attributes tracking development of second cancers
3. **Long-term QoL comparisons between fusion variants** - This type of analysis is not available in the database

## What This Means

**This question is outside the scope of cBioPortal data.** cBioPortal contains cancer genomics research data from published studies, including mutation frequencies, clinical attributes like survival, and treatment records. However, it does not systematically capture:

- Patient-reported quality of life outcomes
- Long-term follow-up data on secondary malignancies
- Comparative analyses of how different fusion variants affect these specific outcomes

To answer your question about how EML4-ALK fusion variants affect long-term quality of life and secondary cancer risk, you would need to consult:
- Clinical trial databases with QoL endpoints
- Long-term follow-up studies specifically designed to track these outcomes
- Published literature on ALK-positive lung cancer patient outcomes
