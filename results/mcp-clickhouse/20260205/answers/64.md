# Question 64

**Type:** Pan-Cancer Specificity Analysis

**Question:** Can you identify a mutations that are highly specific to a single cancer type? 

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now let me compile a comprehensive summary of cancer-specific mutations:

## Cancer-Specific Mutations Identified in cBioPortal

Based on my analysis of the cBioPortal database, I've identified several mutations that are highly specific to single cancer types. Here are the most notable findings:

### **Top Cancer-Specific Mutations (by specificity %)**

1. **VHL in Renal Cell Carcinoma** - **62% specificity**
   - 1,737 out of 2,796 total VHL mutations (62.1%)
   - VHL is the hallmark tumor suppressor gene in clear cell renal cell carcinoma
   - Associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome

2. **APC in Colorectal Cancer** - **63% specificity**
   - 16,602 out of 26,342 total APC mutations (63.0%)
   - APC is the gatekeeper gene for colorectal cancer
   - Mutations occur in >80% of sporadic colorectal cancers

3. **SPOP in Prostate Cancer** - **57% specificity**
   - 2,281 out of 3,996 total SPOP mutations (57.1%)
   - SPOP is one of the most frequently mutated genes in prostate cancer
   - Defines a distinct molecular subtype

4. **STK11 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** - **64% specificity**
   - 3,997 out of 6,245 total STK11 mutations (64.0%)
   - Associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
   - Common co-mutation with KRAS in lung adenocarcinoma

5. **KEAP1 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** - **62% specificity**
   - 4,112 out of 6,683 total KEAP1 mutations (61.5%)
   - Regulates oxidative stress response
   - Often co-mutated with STK11

6. **TCF7L2 in Colorectal Cancer** - **62% specificity**
   - 2,914 out of 4,663 total TCF7L2 mutations (62.5%)
   - Key transcription factor in Wnt signaling pathway
   - Critical for colorectal tumorigenesis

### **Highly Specific Mutations in Rare Cancers**

7. **GNAQ/GNA11 in Uveal Melanoma**
   - GNAQ: 224 mutations in uveal melanoma (18.6% of all GNAQ mutations)
   - GNA11: 215 mutations in uveal melanoma (18.7% of all GNA11 mutations)
   - **Together, GNAQ and GNA11 mutations occur in ~85% of uveal melanomas**
   - These are virtually pathognomonic for uveal melanoma when found together

8. **IDH1 in Glioma** - **39% specificity**
   - 2,226 out of 5,714 total IDH1 mutations (39.0%)
   - Defines a major molecular subtype of glioma
   - Associated with better prognosis

9. **EGFR in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** - **55% specificity**
   - 7,401 out of 13,580 total EGFR mutations (54.5%)
   - Major therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinoma
   - Predicts response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors

10. **KRAS in Pancreatic Cancer** - **28% specificity**
    - 10,083 out of 35,904 total KRAS mutations (28.1%)
    - Found in >90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas
    - While KRAS is mutated across many cancers, pancreatic cancer has the highest frequency

### **B-Cell Lymphoma-Specific Mutations**

11. **BTG1 in Mature B-Cell Neoplasms** - **73% specificity**
    - 275 out of 375 total BTG1 mutations (73.3%)
    - Highly specific to B-cell malignancies

12. **IGLV3-1 in Mature B-Cell Neoplasms** - **90% specificity**
    - 104 out of 116 total mutations (89.7%)
    - Immunoglobulin gene mutations are characteristic of B-cell lymphomas

### **Key Insights:**

- **VHL, APC, SPOP, STK11, and KEAP1** show the highest cancer-type specificity (>60%)
- **Uveal melanoma** has unique molecular signatures with GNAQ/GNA11 mutations
- **Colorectal cancer** is characterized by APC, TCF7L2, and KRAS mutations
- **Lung adenocarcinoma** has multiple specific drivers: EGFR, STK11, KEAP1
- **Prostate cancer** has SPOP as a highly specific marker
- **Renal cell carcinoma** is defined by VHL mutations

These cancer-specific mutations are clinically important for:
- **Diagnosis and classification** of cancer subtypes
- **Prognostic stratification** of patients
- **Therapeutic targeting** (e.g., EGFR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors)
- **Understanding cancer biology** and tumor evolution
