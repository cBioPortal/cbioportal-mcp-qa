# Question 17

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What are the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the clinical data to find this information.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    attribute_value AS primary_diagnosis_site,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) AS patient_count\nFROM clinical_data_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND attribute_name = 'PRIMARY_SITE'\n    AND attribute_value != ''\nGROUP BY attribute_value\nORDER BY patient_count DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Lung","patient_count":7773},{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Breast","patient_count":5358},{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Prostate","patient_count":3208},{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Pancreas","patient_count":3104},{"primary_diagnosis_site":"Colon","patient_count":2516}]}
```


Based on the MSK-CHORD study data, here are the **top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites**:

1. **Lung** - 7,773 patients (most common)
2. **Breast** - 5,358 patients
3. **Prostate** - 3,208 patients
4. **Pancreas** - 3,104 patients
5. **Colon** - 2,516 patients

Lung cancer is by far the most represented primary site in this study, followed by breast cancer. These five sites together represent a significant portion of the MSK-CHORD cohort, which focuses on patients with advanced cancer who received immune checkpoint inhibitors.
