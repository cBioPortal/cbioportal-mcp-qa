# Question 28

**Type:** Basic Query - Pathway Analysis

**Question:** "What percentage of glioblastoma patients have alterations in RB pathway genes (CDKN2A, CDK4, RB1)?"

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a detailed answer to the user's question.

## Answer: RB Pathway Alterations in Glioblastoma Patients

Based on analysis of cBioPortal data across **19 glioblastoma and diffuse glioma studies** encompassing **7,118 unique patients**, here are the findings:

### Overall Statistics

**48.17%** (3,429 out of 7,118) of glioblastoma/diffuse glioma patients have alterations in at least one RB pathway gene (CDKN2A, CDK4, or RB1).

### Individual Gene Alterations

| Gene | Patients Altered | Percentage | Primary Alteration Type |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------------------|
| **CDKN2A** | 2,507 | 35.22% | Deep Deletion (2,438 patients) |
| **CDK4** | 706 | 9.92% | Amplification (665 patients) |
| **RB1** | 460 | 6.46% | Mutation (329 patients) |

### Alteration Type Breakdown

- **CDKN2A**: Predominantly copy number alterations (2,444 patients with CNAs vs 71 with mutations)
  - Deep deletions: 2,438 patients
  - Mutations: 71 patients
  
- **CDK4**: Predominantly amplifications (690 patients with CNAs vs 19 with mutations)
  - Amplifications: 665 patients
  - Mutations: 19 patients
  
- **RB1**: More balanced between mutations and CNAs (329 mutations vs 142 CNAs)
  - Mutations: 329 patients
  - Deep deletions: 137 patients

### Variation Across Studies

The percentage of patients with RB pathway alterations varies significantly by study:

**Highest rates (GBM-specific studies):**
- Brain Tumor PDXs (Mayo): 89.52%
- Glioblastoma (CPTAC): 81.82%
- Glioblastoma (TCGA, Nature 2008): 76.70%
- Glioblastoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas): 74.36%
- Glioblastoma (TCGA, Firehose Legacy): 71.12%

**Lower rates (Lower-grade glioma studies):**
- IDH-mutated Diffuse Glioma (MSK): 9.59%
- Diffuse Glioma (TCGA, GDC): 14.34%
- Brain Lower Grade Glioma (TCGA, PanCancer): 17.12%
- Brain Lower Grade Glioma (TCGA, Firehose): 18.41%

This pattern reflects the known biology that RB pathway alterations are more common in high-grade glioblastomas compared to lower-grade gliomas.
