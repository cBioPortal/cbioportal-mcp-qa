# Question 46

**Type:** Pan-Cancer BRAF Analysis

**Question:** Which cancer types show the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now I have the complete data. Let me present this in a clear summary:

## BRAF V600E Mutation Frequencies Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas Studies

Based on the analysis of all 32 TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, here are the cancer types showing the **highest frequencies of BRAF V600E mutations**:

### Top 10 Cancer Types by BRAF V600E Frequency:

| Rank | Cancer Type | BRAF V600E Cases | Total Samples | Frequency |
|------|-------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Thyroid Carcinoma** | 284 | 500 | **56.8%** |
| 2 | **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma** | 158 | 448 | **35.3%** |
| 3 | **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma** | 48 | 594 | **8.1%** |
| 4 | Cholangiocarcinoma | 1 | 36 | 2.8% |
| 5 | Lung Adenocarcinoma | 9 | 566 | 1.6% |
| 6 | Glioblastoma Multiforme | 5 | 592 | 0.8% |
| 7 | Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma | 2 | 283 | 0.7% |
| 8 | Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma | 1 | 411 | 0.2% |
| 9 | Brain Lower Grade Glioma | 1 | 514 | 0.2% |
| 10 | Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma | 1 | 523 | 0.2% |

### Key Findings:

1. **Thyroid Carcinoma** shows by far the highest BRAF V600E frequency at **56.8%** - more than half of all thyroid cancer samples harbor this mutation.

2. **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma** has the second highest frequency at **35.3%**, which is consistent with the well-known role of BRAF V600E in melanoma.

3. **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma** shows a notable frequency of **8.1%**, representing 48 cases out of 594 samples.

4. All other cancer types show BRAF V600E frequencies below 3%, with most below 1%.

5. In total, **510 samples** across the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas harbor the BRAF V600E mutation, with the vast majority concentrated in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma.

These findings align with clinical knowledge that BRAF V600E is a key driver mutation in thyroid cancer and melanoma, and is also present at lower frequencies in colorectal cancer and other tumor types.
