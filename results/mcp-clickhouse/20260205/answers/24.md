# Question 24

**Type:** Treatment Response

**Question:** Which genomic alterations are associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis, I need to provide you with an important finding:

## Finding: MSK-CHORD Study Does Not Include Melanoma Patients

After thoroughly examining the MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024) study in cBioPortal, I found that **this study does not contain melanoma patients**. 

### MSK-CHORD Study Composition:

The MSK-CHORD study includes 25,040 tumor samples from 24,950 patients, but focuses exclusively on **five cancer types**:

1. **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** (7,809 samples)
2. **Colorectal Cancer** (5,543 samples)
3. **Breast Cancer** (5,368 samples)
4. **Prostate Cancer** (3,211 samples)
5. **Pancreatic Cancer** (3,109 samples)

### Available Immunotherapy-Related Data in MSK-CHORD:

While the study doesn't include melanoma, it does contain immunotherapy-related clinical annotations for the cancer types it covers:

- **Treatment data**: Clinical timeline events with treatment subtype "Immuno" (immunotherapy)
- **PD-L1 status**: Both patient-level history (`HISTORY_OF_PDL1`) and sample-level (`PDL1_POSITIVE`) annotations derived from NLP
- **TMB (Tumor Mutational Burden)**: `TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS` values
- **MSI status**: Microsatellite instability scores and types
- **Survival data**: Overall survival months and status

### Recommendation:

If you're interested in genomic alterations associated with immunotherapy response in **melanoma** specifically, you would need to look at other studies in cBioPortal that focus on melanoma/skin cancer. Would you like me to search for melanoma-specific studies with immunotherapy data in the cBioPortal database?
