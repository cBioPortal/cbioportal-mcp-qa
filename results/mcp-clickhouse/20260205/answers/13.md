# Question 13

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What percentage of patients in the MSK-CHORD Study have at least one TP53 mutation?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have both numbers. Let me calculate the percentage:

**Results for MSK-CHORD Study (msk_chord_2024):**

- **Total patients:** 24,950
- **Patients with at least one TP53 mutation:** 13,105
- **Percentage:** 52.51%

More than half (52.51%) of patients in the MSK-CHORD Study have at least one TP53 mutation. This high frequency is consistent with TP53 being one of the most commonly mutated genes across many cancer types, as it plays a critical role in tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation.
