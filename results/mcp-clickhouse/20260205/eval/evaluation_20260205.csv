How many studies are in cBioPortal?,2,"The LLM Output states there are 511 studies, but the expected answer is 516. This is a factual discrepancy of 5 studies, making the answer partially accurate rather than completely correct.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of studies in cBioPortal. It directly answers what was asked without leaving any aspect of the question unaddressed.,3,"The core answer 'There are 511 studies in cBioPortal' is direct and to the point. The model information section is metadata and not part of the substantive answer, so it doesn't detract from conciseness.",3,"The LLM Output is based entirely on a query to the cBioPortal database (the provided context/source). The answer of 511 comes directly from the database query result shown in the output, demonstrating complete faithfulness to the source.",,,,
How many glioblastoma studies are in cBioPortal?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies 7 glioblastoma studies in cBioPortal, which matches the expected answer. The database query results confirm this count, and all 7 study identifiers are accurately listed.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact count (7) and goes beyond by listing all studies with their identifiers, names, and descriptions. This provides comprehensive information about the glioblastoma studies available.",2,"While the core answer (7 studies) is stated clearly, the output includes extensive details about each study including descriptions, sample sizes, and data sources. For a simple 'how many' question, this level of detail is somewhat verbose, though it may be valuable for context.",3,"All information in the output is directly derived from the database queries shown in the output. The study count, identifiers, names, and descriptions all come from the clickhouse query results. No external information or hallucinations are present.",,,,
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output states 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which exactly matches the expected answer of '24,950 Patients and 25,040 samples'.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the patient count and sample count for the MSK-CHORD Study. It also adds helpful context about the relationship between patients and samples.,2,"The core answer is concise and direct. However, the additional observation about most patients having one sample and the slight difference in counts, while informative, adds some verbosity beyond what was strictly asked.",3,"The answer is entirely based on the database query results shown in the output. The numbers (24,950 patients and 25,040 samples) come directly from the query result, and the observation about the relationship is a straightforward interpretation of those numbers without introducing external information.",,,,
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly states there are 15,928 primary samples in the MSK-CHORD study, which exactly matches the expected answer of '15,928 primary samples'.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of primary samples requested. The additional context about other sample types (metastasis, unknown, local recurrence) is supplementary but doesn't detract from the completeness of answering the core question.",2,"The core answer is provided clearly and directly ('there are **15,928 primary samples**'), but the output includes additional context about other sample types that, while potentially useful, was not requested in the original question. The answer could have been more concise by stopping after stating the primary sample count.",3,"The answer is entirely based on the database query results shown in the output. The final query to the clinical_sample table clearly shows the count of 15,928 for 'Primary' samples, and all information provided (including the breakdown of other sample types) comes directly from the query results with no external information or hallucinations.",,,,
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies Fluorouracil as the most common treatment with 6,319 patients, which matches the expected answer exactly.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by clearly stating that Fluorouracil was the most commonly received treatment and provides the specific patient count. The additional context about top 5 treatments enhances understanding without detracting from completeness.,2,"While the core answer is direct and clear, the output includes additional information about combination therapy regimens (FOLFOX) and speculation about gastrointestinal cancer patients that, while potentially useful, goes beyond what was asked. The question only asked for the most common treatment, not explanations about treatment combinations.",2,"The primary answer (Fluorouracil being the most common treatment) is directly from the query results. However, the output includes external knowledge not present in the provided context, such as the explanation about FOLFOX regimen combinations and the inference about gastrointestinal cancer patients in the study. This additional information, while potentially accurate, is not traceable to the provided database query results.",,,,
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies the top 5 genes (TP53, MUC16, TTN, ATRX, DNAH9) in the correct order. However, the percentages are incorrect. The expected answer shows TP53 at 22.4%, but the LLM reports 32 samples out of 160 total, which equals 20%. Similarly, MUC16 and TTN should be 11.2% (16/143 ≈ 11.2%), but the LLM calculates against 160 samples. The raw counts appear correct, but the percentage calculations or the denominator used differs from the expected answer.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing all top 5 most frequently mutated genes with their mutation counts. It goes beyond the basic requirement by also providing context about the total number of samples and additional biological insights about each gene.,2,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the output includes additional commentary about gene functions and biological significance that, while informative, makes it somewhat verbose. The key findings section and biological interpretations extend beyond what was strictly asked for in the question.",3,"The LLM Output relies entirely on data retrieved from the cbioportal database through the queries shown. The gene names, mutation counts, and sample numbers are all directly traceable to the query results. The biological context provided (e.g., TP53 as tumor suppressor, gene sizes) represents general scientific knowledge but doesn't contradict or misrepresent the database results.",,,,
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output does not provide any answer to the question. Instead, it reports an API error (500: Internal Server Error), which means no factual information about the mutated genes was retrieved or presented.",1,"The output completely fails to address the user's question. No information about the top 5 mutated genes is provided due to the API error. The expected answer should have included TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, and EGFR with their respective frequencies.",3,"While the output doesn't answer the question, it is concise in reporting the error. It directly states the API failure without unnecessary elaboration, and the model information section is standard metadata.",3,"The output is faithful in that it accurately reports what occurred (an API error) rather than fabricating data.

The question remains entirely unanswered.",3,"While the output doesn't answer the question, the error message itself is concise and direct. It clearly states the problem (API request failed with status 500) without unnecessary elaboration. The model information section is standard metadata and doesn't detract from conciseness.",3,"The LLM Output does not introduce any hallucinated information or external knowledge. It honestly reports a technical failure (API error) rather than fabricating an answer. While it fails to provide the answer, it doesn't make up information or claim knowledge it doesn't have.",,,,"This is a system failure case where the LLM attempted to query a database but encountered a server error, preventing it from retrieving and providing the requested information."
What is the correlation between tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability status in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output does not provide any factual information about the correlation.
