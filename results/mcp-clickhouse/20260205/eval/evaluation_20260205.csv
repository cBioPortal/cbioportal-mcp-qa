How many studies are in cBioPortal?,2,"The LLM Output states there are 511 studies, while the expected answer is 516. This is close but not exactly correct, representing a difference of 5 studies. The answer is partially accurate.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of studies in cBioPortal. It directly answers what was asked without leaving any aspect of the question unaddressed.,2,"While the core answer is concise, the output includes additional formatting elements like 'Question 1', 'Type: Study Discovery', and a 'Model Information' section that, while potentially useful metadata, add verbosity beyond what's needed to answer the simple question.",3,The answer appears to be derived from querying the cBioPortal database as specified in the Context/Source. The LLM is providing information based on the database query results rather than external knowledge or hallucination.,,,
How many glioblastoma studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM Output states there are 24 studies (or 18-19 glioblastoma-specific studies), which is significantly different from the expected answer of 7. This represents a major factual discrepancy.",3,"The output fully addresses the question by providing a numerical answer and extensive supporting details about the types of studies found, including specific examples and sample sizes.",1,"The output is excessively verbose for a simple counting question. It includes extensive lists of study types, specific study names, sample sizes, and clarifications that are unnecessary when the question only asks for a count.",3,"The output appears to be based on an actual query to the cBioPortal database as indicated by the context. While the count differs from the expected answer, the LLM is reporting what it found in the database rather than fabricating information or using external knowledge.",,,
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly states that the MSK-CHORD Study contains 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which exactly matches the expected answer.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the number of patients and samples requested. It also adds helpful context about the relationship between these numbers.,2,"While the core answer is direct, the output includes additional commentary ('This is a large-scale study with slightly more samples than patients...') and extensive metadata (Model Information section, generation timestamp) that, while potentially useful, makes it somewhat verbose for a simple statistical query.",3,"The numerical data (24,950 patients and 25,040 samples) is directly from the provided context. The observation that there are more samples than patients is a logical inference from the provided numbers rather than external information or hallucination.",,,
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output states that the MSK-CHORD study contains 15,928 primary samples, which exactly matches the expected answer of '15,928 primary samples'. The information is factually accurate.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of primary samples (15,928) and adds helpful context by clarifying what 'primary' means in this context (Primary tumor samples as opposed to metastatic, recurrent, or other sample types).",2,"While the core answer is direct, the output includes additional clarification about what 'Primary' samples mean, which is somewhat helpful but not strictly necessary to answer the question. The Model Information section is noted to be ignored per instructions. The answer could have been more concise by simply stating the number without the extended explanation.",3,"The answer relies on information from the cbioportal database as specified in the Context/Source. The number provided (15,928) matches the expected answer, indicating it was derived from the source. The clarification about sample types is a reasonable interpretation of standard clinical data classifications in cbioportal and does not appear to be a hallucination.",,,
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies Fluorouracil as the most common treatment, which matches the expected answer. The specific statistics provided (6,319 patients, 29.4%) appear to be derived from the database query.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by clearly stating that Fluorouracil was the most commonly administered treatment. It goes beyond the minimum requirement by providing comprehensive treatment data and context.,2,"While the core answer (Fluorouracil) is clearly stated upfront, the output includes extensive additional information such as a top 10 list of treatments, key findings, and contextual information about FOLFOX regimens. This is somewhat verbose for a straightforward question asking only about the most common treatment, though the additional context may be valuable.",3,"The output explicitly states it is based on 'MSK-CHORD study data' from the cbioportal database. All statistics and treatment information appear to be derived from database queries. The contextual interpretation about FOLFOX regimens, while additional analysis, is a reasonable inference from the data pattern shown rather than external hallucination.",,,
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,3,"The LLM output is highly accurate. Comparing to the expected answer: TP53 (22.7% vs 22.4%), MUC16 (11.3% vs 11.2%), TTN (11.3% vs 11.2%), ATRX (7.8% vs 7.7%), and DNAH9 (7.1% vs 7.0%). The minor differences (0.1-0.3%) are negligible and likely due to rounding or slight data updates, making the output essentially correct.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing all top 5 most frequently mutated genes with their mutation frequencies. It goes beyond the minimum requirement by also including additional context such as the number of mutated samples, total mutations, and brief descriptions of the genes' biological significance.",2,"While the core answer (the table with the top 5 genes) is concise and well-presented, the output includes additional 'Key Findings' section with interpretative commentary about each gene's biological role and significance. This extra information, while potentially useful, makes the response somewhat verbose for a straightforward data query. The model information section at the end is metadata and excluded from evaluation per instructions.",3,"The LLM output appears to be based entirely on data retrieved from the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The mutation frequencies and gene rankings align with the expected answer, indicating the information was faithfully extracted from the source. The biological descriptions of genes (e.g., TP53 as tumor suppressor, ATRX's role in chromatin remodeling) represent general scientific knowledge that contextualizes the data but doesn't contradict or go beyond what would be expected from a database query result.",,,
