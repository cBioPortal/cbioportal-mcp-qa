# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently altered genes in a structural variant in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the cBioPortal database, **the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc) does not contain structural variant data**.

The study includes the following data types:
- **Mutations** (whole exome sequencing)
- **Copy number alterations** (GISTIC)
- **mRNA expression** (RNA-Seq in multiple formats: TPM, FPKM, read counts)

However, there is no structural variant profile available for this study, so I cannot provide the top 5 most frequently altered genes in structural variants.

If you're interested in other types of genomic alterations in this study, I can help you find:
- The most frequently mutated genes
- The most frequently copy number altered genes
- Or any other analysis using the available data types

Would you like me to analyze one of these alternative data types instead?
