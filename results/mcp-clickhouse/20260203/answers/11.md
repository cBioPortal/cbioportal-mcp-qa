# Question 11

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study**:

| Rank | Gene | Samples with Mutation | Total Mutations |
|------|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 13,124 | 13,876 |
| 2 | **KRAS** | 7,128 | 7,231 |
| 3 | **APC** | 4,777 | 7,187 |
| 4 | **PIK3CA** | 3,708 | 4,178 |
| 5 | **EGFR** | 2,159 | 2,556 |

**Key findings:**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in over 13,000 samples
- **KRAS** is the second most common, present in over 7,000 samples
- **APC** shows a notable pattern with 4,777 samples having 7,187 total mutations, indicating some samples have multiple APC mutations
- These genes are well-known cancer drivers frequently mutated across various cancer types

The MSK-CHORD study is a large pan-cancer cohort, so these results reflect commonly mutated genes across multiple cancer types.
