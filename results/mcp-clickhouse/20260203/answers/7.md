# Question 7

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently copy number altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Here are the **top 5 most frequently copy number altered genes** in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc):

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Samples Altered | Frequency |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | **LINC00901** | 32 / 81 | 39.5% |
| 2 | **RN7SL442P** | 31 / 81 | 38.3% |
| 3 | **UBB** | 30 / 81 | 37.0% |
| 4 | **DRC3** | 30 / 81 | 37.0% |
| 5 | **TBC1D26-AS1** | 30 / 81 | 37.0% |

**Key findings:**
- The study contains 81 samples with copy number alteration data
- The most frequently altered genes show CNAs in approximately 37-40% of samples
- The top genes include long non-coding RNAs (LINC00901, TBC1D26-AS1), a pseudogene (RN7SL442P), and protein-coding genes (UBB - ubiquitin B, DRC3 - dynein regulatory complex subunit 3)
- These high-frequency CNAs may reflect recurrent chromosomal regions affected in osteosarcoma
