# Question 14

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** Which cancer type has the highest average tumor mutational burden across all studies?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the cBioPortal database, **Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC)** has the highest average tumor mutational burden across all studies.

## Key Findings:

**Top 5 Cancer Types by Average TMB:**

1. **Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC)**: 53.17 mutations/Mb
   - 176 samples across 4 studies
   - Range: 0.23 - 510.47 mutations/Mb

2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: 52.74 mutations/Mb
   - 293 samples
   - Range: 0.0 - 235.42 mutations/Mb

3. **Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST)**: 50.65 mutations/Mb
   - 15 samples
   - Range: 0.0 - 135.32 mutations/Mb

4. **Desmoplastic Melanoma**: 29.49 mutations/Mb
   - 20 samples
   - Range: 0.7 - 87.87 mutations/Mb

5. **Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM)**: 20.56 mutations/Mb
   - 2,462 samples (largest cohort in top 5)
   - Range: 0.0 - 1,060.23 mutations/Mb

## Context:

The dominance of **skin cancers** (CSCC, BCC, and melanomas) at the top of this list is consistent with the known biology of UV-induced DNA damage, which causes high mutation rates in sun-exposed skin. These cancer types are well-documented to have among the highest TMB values across all cancer types, making them particularly responsive to immunotherapy approaches.
