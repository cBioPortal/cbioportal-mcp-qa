# Question 9

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** "What are the top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET for mutations, copy numbers and SVs combined?"

**Answer:**

## Top 5 Frequently Altered Genes in TARGET Osteosarcoma Study

Based on the **Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)** study with 159 total samples, here are the top 5 most frequently altered genes combining mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), and structural variants (SVs):

| Rank | Gene | Altered Samples | Frequency | Mutations | CNAs | SVs | Total Events |
|------|------|----------------|-----------|-----------|------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 38 | 23.9% | 32 | 6 | 0 | 39 |
| 2 | **LINC00901** | 32 | 20.1% | 0 | 32 | 0 | 32 |
| 3 | **TRIM16** | 31 | 19.5% | 1 | 30 | 0 | 31 |
| 4 | **MYO15A** | 31 | 19.5% | 2 | 30 | 0 | 32 |
| 5 | **RN7SL442P** | 31 | 19.5% | 0 | 31 | 0 | 31 |

### Key Findings:

- **TP53** is the most frequently altered gene (23.9%), predominantly through mutations (32 samples) with some copy number alterations (6 samples)
- The remaining top genes (LINC00901, TRIM16, MYO15A, RN7SL442P) are primarily altered through copy number changes
- No structural variants were detected in the top 5 genes
- TP53 alterations are consistent with its known role as a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in osteosarcoma
