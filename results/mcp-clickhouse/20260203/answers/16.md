# Question 16

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many unique patients have both primary and metastatic samples in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have a complete picture. Let me provide you with the answer:

## Answer

**26 unique patients** in the MSK-CHORD study have both primary and metastatic samples.

### Additional Context:
- **Total patients with Primary or Metastasis samples:** 24,718
- **Patients with at least one Primary sample:** 15,872
- **Patients with at least one Metastasis sample:** 8,872
- **Patients with both Primary AND Metastasis samples:** 26

This means that only a very small fraction (0.1%) of patients in the MSK-CHORD study have samples from both primary and metastatic sites, which makes sense as most patients typically have samples collected from either the primary tumor or metastatic sites, but not both.
