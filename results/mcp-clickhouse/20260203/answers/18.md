**Answer:**

Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a summary answer to the user.

## Most Frequently Administered Systemic Therapy Regimens for Lung Cancer Patients in MSK-CHORD

Based on the MSK-CHORD study (25,040 samples from 24,950 patients), here are the most frequently administered systemic therapy regimens for **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)** patients:

### **Top Single-Agent Therapies:**

1. **Osimertinib** - 1,319 treatment courses (1,064 patients)
   - Targeted therapy for EGFR-mutant NSCLC

2. **Pembrolizumab** - 841 courses (756 patients)
   - Immunotherapy (PD-1 inhibitor)

3. **Erlotinib** - 798 courses (486 patients)
   - Targeted therapy for EGFR-mutant NSCLC

4. **Gemcitabine** - 740 courses (715 patients)
   - Chemotherapy

5. **Nivolumab** - 583 courses (541 patients)
   - Immunotherapy (PD-1 inhibitor)

### **Top Combination Regimens:**

1. **Carboplatin + Pemetrexed** - 1,228 courses (1,193 patients)
   - Standard platinum-based chemotherapy doublet

2. **Cisplatin + Pemetrexed** - 695 courses (687 patients)
   - Platinum-based chemotherapy doublet

3. **Carboplatin + Pembrolizumab + Pemetrexed** - 641 courses (634 patients)
   - Chemo-immunotherapy combination

4. **Bevacizumab + Carboplatin + Pemetrexed** - 462 courses (454 patients)
   - Chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic agent

5. **Carboplatin + Paclitaxel** - 443 courses (431 patients)
   - Classic platinum-taxane doublet

6. **Gemcitabine + Vinorelbine** - 315 courses (310 patients)
   - Non-platinum chemotherapy doublet

7. **Docetaxel + Ramucirumab** - 314 courses (311 patients)
   - Second-line chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic agent

8. **Bevacizumab + Cisplatin + Pemetrexed** - 159 courses (159 patients)

9. **Carboplatin + Etoposide** - 156 courses (144 patients)
   - Typically used for small cell lung cancer

10. **Ipilimumab + Nivolumab** - 132 courses (128 patients)
    - Dual immunotherapy combination

### **Key Observations:**

- **Platinum-based chemotherapy** (carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed) remains the most common backbone
- **Immunotherapy** is frequently used both as monotherapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and in combination with chemotherapy
- **Targeted therapies** (osimertinib, erlotinib, crizotinib, alectinib) are commonly used as single agents for patients with specific driver mutations
- **Chemo-immunotherapy combinations** (e.g., carboplatin + pembrolizumab + pemetrexed) represent modern first-line treatment approaches

This data reflects real-world treatment patterns at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and demonstrates the evolution toward personalized and immunotherapy-based approaches in lung cancer treatment.
