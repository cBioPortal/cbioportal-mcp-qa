How many studies are in cBioPortal?,2,"The LLM Output states there are 511 studies, but the expected answer is 516. This is close but not accurate, representing a difference of 5 studies. The answer is partially correct as it's in the right ballpark but not the exact number.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of studies in cBioPortal. It directly answers what was asked without leaving any aspect of the question unaddressed.,2,"The core answer is concise ('There are 511 studies currently in cBioPortal'), but the output includes additional formatting elements like 'Question 1', 'Type: Study Discovery', and a 'Model Information' section that, while potentially useful metadata, add verbosity beyond what's needed to answer the simple numerical question.",3,"The LLM Output explicitly states it retrieved this information from the cBioPortal database as specified in the Context/Source. While the number is slightly off from the expected answer, the response indicates it relied on the provided source rather than external knowledge or hallucination."
How many glioblastoma studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM Output states there are 24 studies (or 18-19 glioblastoma-specific studies), which is significantly different from the expected answer of 7. This represents a major factual inaccuracy.",3,"The output fully addresses the question by providing a numerical answer and extensive supporting details about the types of studies found, even though the number is incorrect.",1,"The output is excessively verbose for a simple counting question. It includes extensive lists of study types, specific study names, sample sizes, and caveats that are unnecessary when the question only asks 'how many.' A simple numerical answer would suffice.",3,"The output appears to be based on an actual search of the cBioPortal database (the stated context/source). While the count differs from the expected answer, there's no evidence of hallucination or use of external knowledge - the discrepancy likely stems from different search criteria or database state rather than fabricated information."
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output provides the exact numbers from the Expected Answer: 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples. The information is factually accurate.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the number of patients and samples requested. It directly answers what was asked.,2,"While the core answer is present, the output includes additional commentary ('This is a large-scale study with slightly more samples than patients, indicating that some patients have multiple samples collected') that, while relevant, goes beyond what was strictly asked. The formatting with headers and model information sections is acceptable per instructions to ignore.",2,"The numerical data (24,950 patients and 25,040 samples) appears to come from the provided context. However, the interpretation that 'some patients have multiple samples collected' is an inference not explicitly stated in the provided Context/Source, representing a minor addition of external reasoning rather than pure reliance on the source material."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output states that the MSK-CHORD study contains 15,928 primary samples, which exactly matches the expected answer of '15,928 primary samples'. The information is factually accurate.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of primary samples (15,928) and adds helpful context by clarifying what 'primary' means in this context (as opposed to metastatic, recurrent, or other sample types).",2,"While the core answer is direct, the output includes some unnecessary formatting elements (Question 4 header, Type classification, Model Information section, and generation timestamp). The clarification about primary vs. other sample types is useful, but the overall structure is somewhat verbose for a straightforward numerical question.",3,The answer directly relies on the cbioportal database as the source and provides information that is consistent with the expected answer. The clarification about sample types (primary vs. metastatic/recurrent) is a reasonable inference from standard clinical data terminology in cbioportal and does not constitute hallucination.
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly identifies Fluorouracil as the most common treatment, which matches the expected answer. The specific statistics provided (6,319 patients, 29.4%) appear to be accurate based on the cbioportal database context.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by clearly identifying Fluorouracil as the most common treatment and providing comprehensive supporting data including patient counts and percentages for multiple treatments.,2,"While the answer directly addresses the question in the first bullet point, it includes extensive additional information about the top 5 treatments, other common treatments, and treatment patterns that, while informative, goes beyond what was asked. A more concise answer would have simply stated Fluorouracil was the most common treatment with its statistics.",3,"The answer appears to rely entirely on data from the cbioportal database as specified in the context. All statistics and treatment information are presented as coming from the MSK-CHORD study data, with no apparent external knowledge or hallucinations introduced."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM Output identifies the correct top 5 genes (TP53, TTN, MUC16, ATRX, DNAH9) but the mutation frequencies are incorrect. The expected answer shows TP53 at 22.4%, MUC16 at 11.2%, TTN at 11.2%, ATRX at 7.7%, and DNAH9 at 7.0%, while the LLM reports TP53 at 20.1%, TTN at 10.1%, MUC16 at 10.1%, ATRX at 6.9%, and DNAH9 at 6.3%. The genes are correct but the percentages differ by 1-2% for each gene.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing all top 5 most frequently mutated genes with their mutation frequencies. It even goes beyond the minimum requirement by providing additional context about the genes and their biological significance.,2,"While the core answer (the table with top 5 genes) is concise and well-presented, the output includes extensive additional information in the 'Key findings' section that, while informative, is not strictly necessary to answer the question. The biological context about each gene adds value but makes the response somewhat verbose.",3,"The LLM Output appears to rely on data from the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The mutation frequencies and gene rankings are presented as data retrieved from the TARGET Osteosarcoma study. While the specific percentages differ slightly from the expected answer, this appears to be a data retrieval issue rather than hallucination or use of external knowledge."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies the top 5 genes (TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, EGFR) in the correct order. However, it provides absolute numbers (samples with mutations) instead of the percentages shown in the expected answer (52.4%, 28.5%, 19.1%, 14.8%, 8.6%). While the genes are correct, the format and metrics differ from what was expected.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying all 5 most frequently mutated genes with supporting data. It provides comprehensive information including both sample counts and total mutations, which actually exceeds the minimum requirement.",2,"While the core answer (the table) is well-structured, the output includes additional commentary such as 'Key findings' and contextual information about the MSK-CHORD study being a pan-cancer cohort. This extra information, while potentially useful, makes the response somewhat verbose when a simple list or table would suffice.",3,"The answer appears to be based on data from the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The specific numbers provided (13,124 samples for TP53, etc.) suggest direct database queries. The additional context about these being cancer driver genes is general knowledge but doesn't contradict or misrepresent the source data."
How many total studies contain mutation data in the cBioPortal database?,2,"The LLM Output states there are 508 studies with mutation data, while the expected answer is 506 studies. This is a minor discrepancy of 2 studies, which could be due to database updates or query timing differences, but it is not perfectly accurate according to the provided expected answer.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of studies containing mutation data. It also adds helpful context by explaining that the count is based on studies with 'MUTATION_EXTENDED' alteration type, which enhances understanding.",2,"The core answer is provided clearly, but the output includes additional formatting elements (Question 15, Type: Data Discovery, Model Information section, timestamp) that add verbosity. However, per instructions, ignoring timestamps and following the structure, the actual answer portion is reasonably concise with only minor additional explanation about the mutation type.",3,"The answer relies on querying the cBioPortal database as specified in the Context/Source. The explanation about 'MUTATION_EXTENDED' alteration type is consistent with standard cBioPortal data structures and represents information that would be obtained from the database itself, not external sources."
How many unique patients have both primary and metastatic samples in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output correctly states that 26 unique patients have both primary and metastatic samples, which matches the expected answer exactly.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number requested (26 patients) and goes beyond by offering additional context about the distribution of sample types across the study population.,2,"While the core answer is clear and direct, the output includes substantial additional context (total patients, breakdown by sample type, percentage calculation, interpretation) that, while informative, makes it somewhat verbose for a straightforward numerical question. The model information and metadata sections are excluded from this evaluation as instructed.",3,"The answer appears to be based entirely on data from the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The specific numbers provided (26 patients with both types, 15,872 with primary, 8,872 with metastasis, 24,718 total) are presented as factual data from the source, with no apparent hallucinations or external knowledge introduced."
What percentage of colorectal cancer samples have KRAS mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM Output provides the correct percentage (42.49%, which rounds to 42.5% as stated in the expected answer), the correct number of mutated samples (2,355), and the correct total number of samples (5,543). All numerical data matches the expected answer.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the requested percentage, along with supporting details including the absolute numbers of samples with mutations and total samples analyzed.",2,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the output includes additional context about published literature and the MSK-IMPACT sequencing platform that, while relevant, goes beyond what was strictly asked. The question only requested the percentage, not validation against literature or methodological details.",2,"The core data (42.49%, 2,355 samples, 5,543 total) appears to come from the cbioportal database as specified. However, the output includes external information not traceable to the provided context, such as the statement that 'KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in colorectal cancer, typically occurring in 40-50% of cases' and details about 'MSK-IMPACT' sequencing of 'over 25,000 tumors,' which represent general knowledge rather than information from the specified source."
