How many total studies contain mutation data in the cBioPortal database?,2.0,"The LLM Output states there are 508 studies with mutation data, while the expected answer is 506 studies. This is a minor discrepancy of 2 studies, which could be due to database updates or query timing differences, but it's not perfectly accurate to the expected answer.",3.0,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing a specific number of studies containing mutation data. It also adds helpful context about what constitutes mutation data (MUTATION_EXTENDED alteration type), which enhances understanding.",2.0,"The answer is mostly concise but includes some additional information about the model configuration and generation timestamp that, while potentially useful for documentation, goes beyond what's needed to answer the question. The explanation about MUTATION_EXTENDED is relevant and helpful, but the model information section adds verbosity.",3.0,"The answer relies on querying the cBioPortal database as specified in the Context/Source.

It clearly states the problem without unnecessary elaboration.",1.0,"The LLM Output provides no information from the cbioportal database source. It fails to retrieve or present any data from the expected source, making it impossible to assess faithfulness to the context. The error suggests a technical failure rather than an attempt to answer based on the provided source.",,,,,
Which cancer types have the highest frequency of EGFR mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?,2.0,"The LLM Output contains some factual discrepancies when compared to the Expected Answer. Most notably, it reports GBM at 21.12% while the Expected Answer states ~15%. The LLM also reports LUAD at 12.37%, which is higher than the 5-10% range mentioned in the Expected Answer. However, the general ranking and identification of key cancer types (glioblastoma, lung cancer, melanoma, endometrial cancer) are consistent with the Expected Answer.",3.0,"The LLM Output fully addresses the question by providing a comprehensive list of cancer types with EGFR mutation frequencies. It covers all the cancer types mentioned in the Expected Answer (glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, glioma, endometrial cancer, esophagogastric cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer) and provides additional detail with a top 10 list and specific percentages.",2.0,"While the answer is well-structured and informative, it is somewhat verbose. The LLM provides a top 10 list with detailed sample counts, key findings section, and model information that, while useful, goes beyond what is strictly necessary to answer the question.

It includes the specific study mentioned in the expected answer (Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) and provides comprehensive details including sample sizes, correlation coefficients, R-squared values, and statistical interpretation. The answer goes beyond the basic requirement by including data from an additional study for validation.",2.0,"While the answer is well-structured and informative, it includes more detail than strictly necessary to answer the question. The inclusion of mean mRNA expression values, standard deviations, and extensive interpretation about post-transcriptional regulation, while valuable, makes the response somewhat verbose. A more concise answer could focus primarily on the correlation values and their interpretation without the additional statistical details.",3.0,"The LLM Output appears to rely entirely on data from cBioPortal database as specified in the context.

Is BRCA1 promoter methylation associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer?,2.0,"The LLM Output correctly identifies a negative correlation between BRCA1 promoter methylation and mRNA expression. However, the specific correlation coefficients differ from the expected answer. The expected answer cites Pearson r = -0.69 and Spearman r = -0.43, while the LLM Output reports -0.418 and -0.609 for different datasets. The directional relationship is correct, but the specific statistical values don't match.",3.0,"The LLM Output fully addresses the question by confirming the association between BRCA1 promoter methylation and decreased mRNA expression. It provides comprehensive evidence including correlation coefficients, sample sizes, stratified analyses, and specific examples. The answer goes beyond the minimum requirement by including data from two different TCGA datasets.",1.0,"The LLM Output is excessively verbose.

What is the median survival time in the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?,1.0,"The LLM Output states that the median overall survival time is 54.5 months, which directly contradicts the Expected Answer. According to the Expected Answer, the median survival time is not available because the Kaplan-Meier curve does not fall below 50%, making it impossible to estimate the median overall survival. The LLM's specific numerical answer of 54.5 months is therefore factually incorrect.",3.0,"The LLM Output does provide a direct answer to the question asked, even though that answer is incorrect. It addresses the specific question about median survival time in the TARGET Pediatric Neuroblastoma study and provides additional context about the dataset.",2.0,"While the answer directly addresses the question, it includes extensive additional statistics (mean survival, range, IQR, survival status distribution) that were not requested. The core answer could have been stated more briefly, though the additional context is somewhat relevant to understanding survival data.",1.0,"The LLM Output appears to have calculated or retrieved a median value that contradicts the source information. The Expected Answer explicitly states that the median cannot be estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve, suggesting the LLM either hallucinated the 54.5 months figure or incorrectly calculated it from raw data without properly interpreting the survival curve. This represents a significant departure from what the source data actually shows.",,,,,
How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?,2.0,"The LLM Output provides generally accurate information about MGMT methylation and survival outcomes, but the specific survival numbers differ from the Expected Answer. For example, the LLM reports 27.2 months for methylated tumors with standard radiation + TMZ, while the Expected Answer states 23.5 months. The LLM reports 14.3 months for unmethylated tumors with the same treatment, while the Expected Answer states 12.7 months. These discrepancies suggest either different data aggregation methods or potential errors in calculation.",3.0,"The LLM Output comprehensively addresses the question by providing: (1) survival data comparing methylated vs unmethylated MGMT across multiple studies, (2) treatment-specific outcomes showing differential response to TMZ-containing regimens, and (3) clear demonstration that MGMT methylation confers both prognostic advantage and treatment response benefit. It covers all aspects requested in the question.",2.0,"While the answer is well-organized and informative, it includes extensive caveats and disclaimers (e.g., 'What This Data Does NOT Tell You' section, model information, generation timestamp) that, while potentially useful for context, make the response somewhat verbose. The core answer could be delivered more directly without the extensive meta-commentary about data limitations.",3.0,"The LLM Output explicitly states it is drawing from cBioPortal data, specifically the gbm_tcga_pub2013 and lgggbm_tcga_pub studies, which aligns with the expected source. All survival statistics and treatment comparisons are presented as coming from these database queries. The output appropriately limits itself to what can be derived from the genomics database and explicitly notes what cannot be determined from this source.",,,,,
For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,3.0,"The LLM correctly identifies that this question cannot be answered with cBioPortal data, which aligns with the expected answer. The explanation about what data IS available (fusion variants, survival data) versus what is NOT available (quality of life measurements, secondary cancer data) appears factually accurate regarding cBioPortal's capabilities.",3.0,"The output fully addresses the question by clearly stating that cBioPortal cannot answer this specific question, explaining why (lack of QoL and secondary cancer data), and providing helpful context about what data IS available and where the user might find the information they need.",2.0,"While the core message is clear, the output includes extensive details about available data in cBioPortal (772 patients, specific fusion variants, survival data statistics) that, while informative, are not strictly necessary to answer that the question is out of scope. A more concise response would focus primarily on the limitations rather than cataloging available data.",3.0,"The output appropriately relies on querying the cBioPortal database as the context/source. The conclusion that quality of life and secondary cancer data are not available in cBioPortal is based on database exploration, and the LLM appropriately directs users to alternative sources without fabricating information.",,,,,
"In the ""Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes"" study what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?",1.0,"The LLM Output provides fundamentally different information from the Expected Answer. The Expected Answer states median overall survival of ~22 months for double mutants vs. not reached for KRAS-only patients, with a log-rank test p-value of 0.0209. The LLM Output instead reports mortality rates (65.24% vs 48.24%) and a chi-square p-value of ~0.008. These are completely different statistical analyses and results, making the output factually incorrect for the question asked.",1.0,"The LLM Output fails to address the core question about survival difference (median survival times) and does not provide the correct statistical test result (log-rank test). Instead, it provides mortality rates and chi-square analysis. The Expected Answer specifically mentions median overall survival times and log-rank test p-value, none of which are present in the LLM Output.",2.0,"While the output is well-structured and organized, it includes extensive details about patient cohorts, mortality rates, and limitations that, while potentially useful, are not directly answering the specific question about survival difference (time-based) and its statistical significance. The answer could have been more direct in addressing the specific metrics requested.",2.0,"The LLM Output appears to have queried the cbioportal database as specified in the Context/Source, but it either accessed different data or performed different analyses than what was expected. The acknowledgment that ""only 4 patients had actual survival time (OS_MONTHS) recorded"" suggests the LLM may have encountered data limitations, but the Expected Answer clearly indicates that proper survival analysis data should be available. This suggests either incomplete data retrieval or analysis of the wrong dataset.",,,,,
Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,1.0,"The LLM output provides extensive details about specific studies and their RNA-seq methods, but according to the expected answer, this information is not actually contained in the cBioPortal database. The expected answer clearly states that 'Library preparation protocols are not contained in the database and should be consulted in the publications underlying the studies.' The LLM appears to have fabricated or inferred information about library preparation methods that should not be available in the database.",1.0,"The LLM failed to provide the correct answer to the question. Instead of directing the user to consult the underlying publications for library preparation protocols (as indicated by the expected answer), it provided detailed information about specific studies and their supposed RNA-seq methods. This completely misses the point that such information is not available in the database.",1.0,"The output is excessively verbose, providing extensive lists of studies, sample counts, gene counts, and detailed breakdowns across multiple categories. Given that the correct answer should simply state that library preparation protocols are not in the database, this level of detail is entirely unnecessary and misleading.",1.0,"The LLM output appears to contain hallucinated information that is not supported by the context/source. The expected answer explicitly states that library preparation protocols are NOT contained in the cBioPortal database, yet the LLM provides detailed information about RNA-seq methods (polyA vs. capture-based) for numerous studies. This suggests the LLM either fabricated this information or drew from external knowledge rather than the actual database contents.",,,,,
In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?,1.0,"The LLM output provides a completely different set of genes (CPB1, NPY1R, SCUBE2, SCGB1D2, STC2) compared to the expected answer (AGR3, TFF1, SRARP, CYP2B7P, CPB1). Only CPB1 appears in both lists, but it's ranked #1 in the LLM output versus #5 in the expected answer. The other four genes are entirely different, indicating the analysis may have used different criteria or thresholds.",3.0,"The output fully addresses the question by providing exactly 5 down-regulated genes with comprehensive details including expression values, fold changes, and percentages. It also provides relevant study context and sample sizes.",2.0,"While the answer provides the requested information, it includes extensive additional details (RSEM values, log2 fold changes, percent changes, study details) that, while informative, make the response somewhat verbose when a simple list of the top 5 genes would have sufficed.",3.0,"The output explicitly states it analyzed data from the cBioPortal database for the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study, which matches the specified context/source. All information appears to be derived from database queries rather than external knowledge.",,,,,

In the TCGA Glioblastoma multiforme study compare the median patient age at diagnosis between patients with IDH1 R132H mutation and patients with wild-type IDH1.,2.0,"The LLM Output reports median ages of 43 years for IDH1 R132H mutant and 59 years for wild-type patients. The expected answer indicates median ages of ~40 years and ~60 years respectively. While the values are close and in the right direction, there are discrepancies: (1) The study referenced differs - LLM uses 'Firehose Legacy' while expected answer references 'PanCancer Atlas', and (2) The exact median values differ slightly (43 vs ~40, 59 vs ~60). The age difference direction and magnitude are correct, but the specific values and study version don't perfectly match.",3.0,"The LLM Output fully addresses the question by providing median ages for both groups, the age difference (16 years), patient counts, age ranges, and additional context about clinical significance. It goes beyond the minimum requirement by including statistical details and interpretation, making it a complete answer.",2.0,"While the core answer (median ages of 43 vs 59 years) is clearly stated, the output includes extensive additional information such as patient distribution percentages, age ranges, clinical significance discussion, and model information that, while relevant, makes the response somewhat verbose for a straightforward comparison question.",3.0,"The LLM Output appears to derive all information from the cbioportal database as specified in the context.
