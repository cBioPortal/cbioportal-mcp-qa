# Question 31

**Type:** Cross-Cancer Mutation Frequency

**Question:** Which cancer types have the highest frequency of EGFR mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find which cancer types have the highest frequency of EGFR mutations across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies.

Let me start by identifying the relevant TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies and then analyze EGFR mutation frequencies by cancer type.

```json
{
  "search": "tcga pan can atlas",

Let me search more broadly for TCGA studies:

Great! I can see there are multiple TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018 studies. Now let me query for EGFR mutation frequencies across all these PanCancer Atlas studies:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH egfr_mutations AS (\n  SELECT \n    cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n    cs.name as study_name,\n    ged.sample_unique_id,\n    ged.hugo_gene_symbol\n  FROM genomic_event_derived ged\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON ged.cancer_study_identifier = cs.cancer_study_identifier\n  WHERE ged.hugo_gene_symbol = 'EGFR'\n    AND ged.variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018'\n),\ntotal_samples AS (\n  SELECT \n    cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n    cs.name as study_name,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT s.stable_id) as total_samples\n  FROM cancer_study cs\n  JOIN sample s ON cs.cancer_study_id = s.cancer_study_id\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  GROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\n)\nSELECT \n  ts.study_name,\n  ts.cancer_study_identifier,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT em.sample_unique_id) as samples_with_egfr_mutation,\n  ts.total_samples,\n  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT em.sample_unique_id) * 100.0 / ts.total_samples, 2) as mutation_frequency_percent\nFROM total_samples ts\nLEFT JOIN egfr_mutations em ON ts.cancer_study_identifier = em.cancer_study_identifier\nGROUP BY ts.study_name, ts.cancer_study_identifier, ts.total_samples\nORDER BY mutation_frequency_percent DESC\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"error_message":"Query execution failed: Received ClickHouse exception, code: 47, server response: Code: 47. DB::Exception: Identifier 's.cancer_study_id' cannot be resolved from table with name s.

(UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER) (version 25.8.1.36912 (official build)) (for url https://dl96orhu96.us-east-1.aws.clickhouse.cloud:8443)"}
```


Let me check the sample table structure:



Calling `clickhouse_list_table_columns` with args:
```json
{
  "table": "sample"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_list_table_columns`:
```json
{"columns":[{"name":"internal_id","type":"Nullable(Int64)","comment":"Primary key. Unique internal identifier for the sample."},{"name":"stable_id","type":"Nullable(String)","comment":"Stable identifier for the sample within the study."},{"name":"patient_id","type":"Nullable(Int64)","comment":"References patient.internal_id."}]}
```


I see - the sample table doesn't have a direct cancer_study_id. Let me adjust the query:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH egfr_mutations AS (\n  SELECT \n    cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n    cs.name as study_name,\n    ged.sample_unique_id,\n    ged.hugo_gene_symbol\n  FROM genomic_event_derived ged\n  JOIN cancer_study cs ON ged.cancer_study_identifier = cs.cancer_study_identifier\n  WHERE ged.hugo_gene_symbol = 'EGFR'\n    AND ged.variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018'\n),\ntotal_samples AS (\n  SELECT \n    cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n    cs.name as study_name,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT s.stable_id) as total_samples\n  FROM cancer_study cs\n  JOIN patient p ON cs.cancer_study_id = p.cancer_study_id\n  JOIN sample s ON p.internal_id = s.patient_id\n  WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  GROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\n)\nSELECT \n  ts.study_name,\n  ts.cancer_study_identifier,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT em.sample_unique_id) as samples_with_egfr_mutation,\n  ts.total_samples,\n  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT em.sample_unique_id) * 100.0 / ts.total_samples, 2) as mutation_frequency_percent\nFROM total_samples ts\nLEFT JOIN egfr_mutations em ON ts.cancer_study_identifier = em.cancer_study_identifier\nGROUP BY ts.study_name, ts.cancer_study_identifier, ts.total_samples\nORDER BY mutation_frequency_percent DESC\n"

I need to include cancer_study_identifier in the egfr_mutations CTE. Let me fix this:

Perfect! Now let me create a more detailed summary of the top cancer types:

## EGFR Mutation Frequencies Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas Studies

Based on analysis of 32 TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, here are the cancer types with the **highest frequency of EGFR mutations**:

### Top 10 Cancer Types by EGFR Mutation Frequency:

1. **Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)** - **15.88%**
   - 94 out of 592 samples with EGFR mutations
   - Highest frequency across all cancer types

2. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** - **12.37%**
   - 70 out of 566 samples with EGFR mutations
   - Second highest, consistent with known EGFR driver mutations in lung cancer

3. **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM)** - **7.81%**
   - 35 out of 448 samples with EGFR mutations

4. **Brain Lower Grade Glioma (LGG)** - **6.81%**
   - 35 out of 514 samples with EGFR mutations

5. **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)** - **6.81%**
   - 36 out of 529 samples with EGFR mutations

6. **Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD)** - **4.77%**
   - 21 out of 440 samples with EGFR mutations

7. **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)** - **2.87%**
   - 14 out of 487 samples with EGFR mutations

8. **Cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL)** - **2.78%**
   - 1 out of 36 samples (small sample size)

9. **Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (ESCA)** - **2.75%**
   - 5 out of 182 samples with EGFR mutations

10. **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD)** - **2.53%**
    - 15 out of 594 samples with EGFR mutations

### Key Findings:

- **Glioblastoma** shows the highest EGFR mutation frequency at nearly 16%, which aligns with known biology where EGFR amplification and mutations are common drivers
- **Lung adenocarcinoma** has the second highest frequency at 12.4%, consistent with EGFR being a major therapeutic target in this cancer type
- **Brain tumors** (GBM and LGG combined) show particularly high EGFR mutation rates
- Most other cancer types show EGFR mutation frequencies below 3%

These findings are consistent with the clinical importance of EGFR as a therapeutic target, particularly in lung cancer and glioblastoma.
