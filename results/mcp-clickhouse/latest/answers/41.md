# MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)

**Study ID:** `msk_chord_2024`

## Overview
Targeted sequencing via MSK-IMPACT panels. Clinical annotations include some derived from natural language processing (denoted NLP).

## Gene Panels
This study uses multiple MSK-IMPACT panel versions:
- **IMPACT341**: Earlier version, 341 genes
- **IMPACT410**: 410 genes
- **IMPACT468**: 468 genes  
- **IMPACT505**: Latest version, 505 genes

**Important:** Different samples may have different gene coverage. Always use gene-specific denominators when calculating mutation frequencies.

## Clinical Attributes - Semantic Guide

FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
  AND attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'
  AND attribute_value = 'Primary';

### Treatment Event Keys

| Key | Description | Example Values |
|-----|-------------|----------------|
| `AGENT` | Drug/treatment name | FLUOROURACIL, PEMBROLIZUMAB, OXALIPLATIN |

| `Radiation Therapy` | Radiation treatment |
| `Biologic` | Biologic agents |
| `Investigational` | Investigational/trial drugs |
| `Bone Treatment` | Bone-targeted agents (bisphosphonates, etc.) |
| `Prior Medications to MSK` | Medications before MSK treatment |

### Query Examples

```sql
-- Get treatments by subtype
SELECT 
    subtype.value as treatment_type,
    agent.value as agent,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ce.patient_id) as patients
FROM clinical_event ce
JOIN clinical_event_data agent ON ce.clinical_event_id = agent.clinical_event_id AND agent.key = 'AGENT'
JOIN clinical_event_data subtype ON ce.clinical_event_id = subtype.clinical_event_id AND subtype.key = 'SUBTYPE'
JOIN patient p ON ce.patient_id = p.internal_id
JOIN cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id
WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
  AND ce.event_type IN ('Treatment', 'TREATMENT')
GROUP BY subtype.value, agent.value
ORDER BY treatment_type, patients DESC;
```

### Treatment Data Caveats
- Some treatment data is NLP-extracted (`INFERRED_TX_PROB` indicates confidence)
- `PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK` captures pre-MSK treatments separately
- Treatment timing (start_date, stop_date) is in days from diagnosis
- **Cannot calculate percentages**: We can't distinguish "not collected" from "not received"

### Treatment Query Patterns for MSK-CHORD

**For broad questions** ("What treatments did patients receive?"):
1. First summarize by SUBTYPE (Chemo, Immuno, Targeted, etc.)
2. Then list top agents within each category

**For specific questions** ("Most common treatment?"):
- Query by AGENT key
- Report patient count, NOT percentage
- Expected answer: Fluorouracil (~6,319 patients)

**For treatment type questions** ("Most common chemotherapy?"):
- Filter by `SUBTYPE = 'Chemo'` and report by AGENT

## Notes & Caveats
- Some clinical annotations are NLP-derived and may have extraction errors
- Multiple IMPACT panel versions mean gene coverage varies by sample
- Data is under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license; contact datarequests@mskcc.org for commercial use

Now let me check what genetic profiles are available for this study:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    gp.stable_id,\n    gp.genetic_alteration_type,\n    gp.datatype,\n    gp.name,\n    gp.description\nFROM genetic_profile gp\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\nORDER BY gp.genetic_alteration_type\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"stable_id":"msk_chord_2024_cna","genetic_alteration_type":"COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION","datatype":"DISCRETE","name":"Putative copy-number alterations from GISTIC","description":"Putative copy-number from GISTIC 2.0.

```


I can see that this study doesn't have protein level data (like pAKT) available. The study only has mutation, copy number alteration, and structural variant data. Let me verify this and provide you with what data is actually available:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT genetic_alteration_type\nFROM genetic_profile gp\nJOIN cancer_study cs ON gp.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n"
}
```

```json
{"rows":[{"genetic_alteration_type":"COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"MUTATION_EXTENDED"},{"genetic_alteration_type":"STRUCTURAL_VARIANT"}]}
```


Let me check if there are any studies with protein level data that include lung squamous cell carcinoma:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:

Great! I can see phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) data is available. The phosphorylated forms are indicated by _PS473 (Serine 473) and _PT308 (Threonine 308). Now let me analyze PTEN alterations and their relationship with pAKT levels:

This is strange - it seems all 317 samples are showing as PTEN altered. Let me check the PTEN alteration frequency:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:

```


Good! So there are 48 samples with homozygous deletions and 51 with mutations. Let me check the total number of samples in the study:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Check total samples in study\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as total_samples\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n"

```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:

Now let me check which samples have pAKT data and whether they overlap with PTEN alterations:

Excellent! Now I have the correct numbers. Let me redo the analysis properly:

This is very strange. Let me check if there's an issue with how the LEFT JOIN is working:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Test the join directly\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) as total_rows,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT pakt.sample_unique_id) as unique_pakt_samples,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT pten.sample_unique_id) as unique_pten_samples,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN pten.sample_unique_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as rows_with_pten,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN pten.sample_unique_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as rows_without_pten\nFROM (\n    SELECT sample_unique_id, alteration_value\n    FROM genetic_alteration_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND profile_type = 'rppa'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'AKT1_PS473'\n      AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\n) pakt\nLEFT JOIN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n    FROM genomic_event_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'PTEN'\n      AND (variant_type = 'mutation' OR (variant_type = 'cna' AND cna_alteration = -2))\n) pten ON pakt.sample_unique_id = pten.sample_unique_id\n"
}
```

```


Ah! This is the issue - all 317 rows are showing as having PTEN alterations, but there are only 68 unique PTEN altered samples. This suggests there might be multiple pAKT measurements per sample. Let me check:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Check if there are multiple pAKT values per sample\nSELECT \n    sample_unique_id,\n    COUNT(*) as num_measurements,\n    groupArray(alteration_value) as values\nFROM genetic_alteration_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  AND profile_type = 'rppa'\n  AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'AKT1_PS473'\nGROUP BY sample_unique_id\nHAVING num_measurements > 1\nLIMIT 10\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[]}
```


That's not it. Let me check the actual count of distinct samples:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Double check distinct sample counts\nSELECT \n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as distinct_samples,\n    COUNT(*) as total_rows\nFROM genetic_alteration_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  AND profile_type = 'rppa'\n  AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'AKT1_PS473'\n  AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"distinct_samples":317,"total_rows":317}]}
```


Let me try a completely different approach - using an INNER JOIN to see what's happening:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Check samples that DON'T have PTEN alterations\nSELECT sample_unique_id\nFROM genetic_alteration_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  AND profile_type = 'rppa'\n  AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'AKT1_PS473'\n  AND sample_unique_id NOT IN (\n      SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n      FROM genomic_event_derived\n      WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n        AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'PTEN'\n        AND (variant_type = 'mutation' OR (variant_type = 'cna' AND cna_alteration = -2))\n  )\nLIMIT 10\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-18-4721-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-18-5592-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-21-1071-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-21-1072-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-21-1076-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-21-1079-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-21-1080-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-21-1082-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-21-5782-01"},{"sample_unique_id":"lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_TCGA-21-5784-01"}]}
```


Good! So there ARE samples without PTEN alterations. The issue must be with the LEFT JOIN. Let me try using NOT IN instead:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Use NOT IN approach for cleaner separation\nWITH pten_altered_list AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n    FROM genomic_event_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n      AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'PTEN'\n      AND (variant_type = 'mutation' OR (variant_type = 'cna' AND cna_alteration = -2))\n)\nSELECT \n    CASE \n        WHEN sample_unique_id IN pten_altered_list THEN 'PTEN Altered'\n        ELSE 'PTEN Wild-type'\n    END as pten_status,\n    COUNT(*) as sample_count,\n    AVG(toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value)) as mean_pakt,\n    median(toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value)) as median_pakt,\n    stddevPop(toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value)) as stddev_pakt,\n    min(toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value)) as min_pakt,\n    max(toFloat64OrNull(alteration_value)) as max_pakt\nFROM genetic_alteration_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n  AND profile_type = 'rppa'\n  AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'AKT1_PS473'\n  AND alteration_value IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY pten_status\nORDER BY pten_status\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

Perfect! Now I have the correct results. Let me also get more detailed information about the types of PTEN alterations:

Interesting! The values are identical across AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 for each phosphorylation site, suggesting these might be pan-AKT antibodies. Let me also perform a statistical test to see if the difference is significant:

Perfect! Now I have all the data needed to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me create a final summary:

## Summary: PTEN Alteration and pAKT Protein Levels in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Based on analysis of the **TCGA Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma PanCancer Atlas dataset** (lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018), I found a **paradoxical relationship** between PTEN alterations and pAKT levels:

### Key Findings:

**1. PTEN Alteration Frequency:**
- Total samples in study: 487
- PTEN mutations: 51 samples (10.5%)
- PTEN homozygous deletions: 48 samples (9.9%)
- **Total PTEN altered: 97 samples (19.9%)**

**2. Protein Data Available:**
- 317 samples with RPPA (Reverse Phase Protein Array) data
- 67 PTEN-altered samples with protein data
- 250 PTEN wild-type samples with protein data

### **Unexpected Finding: PTEN Alterations Associated with HIGHER pAKT Levels**

#### **pAKT-Ser473 (Primary Activation Site):**

| PTEN Status | N | Mean | Median | Std Dev | Q25 | Q75 |
|-------------|---|------|--------|---------|-----|-----|
| **PTEN Wild-type** | 250 | **-0.785** | **-0.880** | 0.756 | -1.346 | -0.408 |
| **PTEN Altered** | 67 | **-0.114** | **-0.157** | 0.921 | -0.809 | 0.537 |

**Difference: +0.67 units higher in PTEN-altered samples**

#### **pAKT-Thr308 (Secondary Activation Site):**

| PTEN Status | N | Mean | Median | Std Dev | Q25 | Q75 |
|-------------|---|------|--------|---------|-----|-----|
| **PTEN Wild-type** | 250 | **0.165** | **0.007** | 0.664 | -0.313 | 0.547 |
| **PTEN Altered** | 67 | **0.827** | **0.838** | 0.813 | 0.316 | 1.545 |

**Difference: +0.66 units higher in PTEN-altered samples**

#### **By Alteration Type (pAKT-Ser473):**

| PTEN Status | N | Mean | Median |
|-------------|---|------|--------|
| PTEN Wild-type | 250 | -0.785 | -0.880 |
| PTEN Mutation | 33 | -0.088 | -0.205 |
| PTEN Homozygous Deletion | 34 | -0.138 | -0.139 |

Both mutation and homozygous deletion show similar increases in pAKT levels.

### Biological Interpretation:

This finding is **counterintuitive** because:
- PTEN normally dephosphorylates PIP3, inhibiting AKT activation
- Loss of PTEN function should theoretically increase pAKT levels
- **The data confirms this expectation**: PTEN-altered tumors show significantly higher pAKT phosphorylation at both Ser473 and Thr308 sites

The **negative values** in the RPPA data represent **z-scores** (standardized values relative to the cohort mean), so:
- PTEN wild-type: pAKT levels are **below average** (negative z-scores)
- PTEN altered: pAKT levels are **closer to or above average** (less negative or positive z-scores)

### Conclusion:

**PTEN alterations (mutations or homozygous deletions) are associated with significantly elevated pAKT protein levels in lung squamous cell carcinoma**, consistent with loss of PTEN's tumor suppressor function and activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This supports the biological role of PTEN
