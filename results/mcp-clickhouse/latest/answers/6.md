# Question 6

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study** (os_target_gdc):

| Rank | Gene | Samples Mutated | Mutation Frequency | Total Mutations |
|------|------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 32 | 20.1% | 33 |
| 2 | **TTN** | 16 | 10.1% | 18 |
| 3 | **MUC16** | 16 | 10.1% | 17 |
| 4 | **ATRX** | 11 | 6.9% | 11 |
| 5 | **DNAH9** | 10 | 6.3% | 10 |

**Key findings:**
- The study contains **159 total samples**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in ~20% of osteosarcoma samples, which is consistent with its known role as a tumor suppressor frequently altered in many cancers including osteosarcoma
- **TTN** (Titin) and **MUC16** (Mucin 16) are tied for second place at ~10% frequency. These are very large genes that often show mutations due to their size rather than functional significance
- **ATRX** (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked) is mutated in ~7% of samples and is known to be involved in chromatin remodeling
- **DNAH9** (Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain 9) rounds out the top 5 at ~6% frequency
