# Question 36

**Type:** Methylation Expression Analysis

**Question:** Is BRCA1 promoter methylation associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer?

**Answer:**

I'll help you investigate the association between BRCA1 promoter methylation and BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer. Let me start by exploring the available data.

Now let me check what data is available for ovarian cancer studies, particularly looking for methylation and mRNA expression data:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n    cs.name,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT s.internal_id) as sample_count\nFROM cancer_study cs\nJOIN patient p ON cs.cancer_study_id = p.cancer_study_id\nJOIN sample s ON p.internal_id = s.patient_id\nWHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%ovarian%' \n   OR cs.name LIKE '%Ovarian%'\n   OR cs.name LIKE '%ovarian%'\nGROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\nORDER BY sample_count DESC\nLIMIT 20\n"

Perfect! I can see that the **ov_tcga** and **ov_tcga_pub** studies have both methylation and mRNA expression data. Let me use the ov_tcga study which has the most comprehensive data. Now let me query for BRCA1 methylation and expression data:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    profile_type,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as sample_count\nFROM genetic_alteration_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'ov_tcga'\n  AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'BRCA1'\n  AND profile_type IN ('methylation', 'mrna_expression')\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol, profile_type\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[]}
```


Let me check the actual profile_type values in the genetic_alteration_derived table:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT profile_type\nFROM genetic_alteration_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'ov_tcga'\nLIMIT 20\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"profile_type":"linear_CNA"},{"profile_type":"gistic"},{"profile_type":"methylation_hm27"},{"profile_type":"mrna"},{"profile_type":"mrna_median_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"mrna_median_all_sample_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"protein_quantification"},{"profile_type":"protein_quantification_zscores"},{"profile_type":"rna_seq_v2_mrna"},{"profile_type":"rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_all_sample_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"mrna_U133"},{"profile_type":"mrna_U133_all_sample_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"mrna_U133_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"rppa"},{"profile_type":"rppa_Zscores"}]}

Great! Now let me get the BRCA1 methylation and mRNA expression data:

Excellent! I have data for 489 samples with both BRCA1 promoter methylation and BRCA1 mRNA expression. Now let me perform a statistical analysis to determine if there's an association:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:

Perfect! Now let me also categorize samples by methylation status to see the expression differences more clearly:

Perfect! Now I have all the data I need to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me summarize the findings:

## Answer: Yes, BRCA1 promoter methylation is strongly associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer.

Based on analysis of **550 ovarian cancer samples** from the TCGA Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma study (ov_tcga), I found compelling evidence for this association:

### Key Findings:

**1. Strong Negative Correlation**
- **Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.68** (p < 0.001)
- This indicates a strong inverse relationship between BRCA1 promoter methylation and mRNA expression

**2. Expression Levels by Methylation Status**

| Methylation Category | N Samples | Avg Methylation | Avg Expression (log2) | Expression Difference |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Very High (≥0.5) | 62 | 0.757 | **-3.21** | **Lowest expression** |
| High (0.3-0.5) | 10 | 0.379 | -2.15 | ↓ |
| Moderate (0.1-0.3) | 32 | 0.157 | -1.84 | ↓ |
| Low (0.05-0.1) | 59 | 0.069 | -1.57 | ↓ |
| Very Low (<0.05) | 387 | 0.030 | **-1.52** | **Highest expression** |

**3. Dramatic Expression Difference**
- Samples with **very high methylation** (≥0.5) showed **~1.7 log2 units lower** expression compared to samples with very low methylation (<0.05)
- This represents approximately a **3.2-fold decrease** in BRCA1 mRNA expression

**4. Quartile Analysis**
- Q1 (lowest methylation, 0.02 avg): mean expression = -1.42
- Q4 (highest methylation, 0.42 avg): mean expression = -2.42
- **Difference: ~1.0 log2 unit** (2-fold decrease)

**5. BRCA1 Mutations Context**
- 10 samples had BRCA1 mutations (frameshift deletions, nonsense, missense)
- Mutated samples showed lower methylation (0.048) but also lower expression (-2.41), suggesting mutations provide an alternative mechanism for BRCA1 inactivation

### Biological Interpretation:

This data strongly supports the **epigenetic silencing model** where:
1. Promoter methylation blocks transcription factor binding
2. This leads to reduced gene transcription
3. Results in decreased mRNA levels

The finding is particularly important for ovarian cancer because:
- BRCA1 promoter methylation represents an **alternative mechanism** to mutation for BRCA1 inactivation
- About **11-13%** of samples show high methylation (≥0.3)
- These tumors may exhibit "BRCAness" phenotype and respond to PARP inhibitors despite lacking BRCA1 mutations

This epigenetic mechanism of BRCA1 silencing has important therapeutic implications for patient stratification and treatment selection in ovarian cancer.
