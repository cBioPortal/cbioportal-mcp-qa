# Question 60

**Type:** Expression comparison

**Question:** In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones in the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study.

First, let me search for the correct study identifier:



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "breast invasive carcinoma tcga"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```


Let me try a broader search:



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "breast tcga"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```


Let me check what tables are available and search for TCGA breast cancer studies:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT cancer_study_identifier, name, description \nFROM cancer_study \nWHERE name LIKE '%Breast%' AND name LIKE '%TCGA%'\nLIMIT 10"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

Great! I found several TCGA breast cancer studies. The most comprehensive one appears to be "brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018". Now I need to check if this database contains gene expression data (mRNA expression) which is needed to identify down-regulated genes:

Perfect! I can see there's a `genetic_alteration_derived` table that contains gene expression data. Let me check the structure and query for down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated vs non-mutated samples:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT DISTINCT profile_type \nFROM genetic_alteration_derived \nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\nLIMIT 20"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"profile_type":"log2CNA"},{"profile_type":"gistic"},{"profile_type":"protein_quantification"},{"profile_type":"protein_quantification_zscores"},{"profile_type":"rna_seq_v2_mrna"},{"profile_type":"rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_all_sample_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"rna_seq_v2_mrna_median_all_sample_ref_normal_Zscores"},{"profile_type":"rppa"},{"profile_type":"rppa_Zscores"}]}
```


Great! I can see there's RNA-seq expression data. Now let me identify TP53 mutated samples and compare gene expression between TP53 mutated and non-mutated samples:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:

}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

Let me check the correct column name in the genetic_alteration_derived table:



Calling `clickhouse_list_table_columns` with args:
```json
{
  "table": "genetic_alteration_derived"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_list_table_columns`:

Now I see - the column is called `alteration_value`, not `value`. Let me fix the query:

Excellent! Here are the results:

## Top 5 Down-Regulated Genes in TP53 Mutated Samples (Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)

Based on the analysis of **1,082 samples** (348 TP53-mutated vs 734 TP53 non-mutated) from the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA PanCancer Atlas study, the top 5 most down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones are:

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Avg Expression (TP53 Mutated) | Avg Expression (TP53 Non-Mutated) | Expression Difference | Fold Change |
|------|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 1 | **CPB1** | 4,393.71 | 50,615.89 | -46,222.17 | ~11.5x lower |
| 2 | **SLC39A6** | 9,997.74 | 34,446.82 | -24,449.08 | ~3.4x lower |
| 3 | **COL1A1** | 125,447.56 | 148,244.17 | -22,796.61 | ~1.2x lower |
| 4 | **XBP1** | 25,076.86 | 47,533.32 | -22,456.46 | ~1.9x lower |
| 5 | **C4A** | 20,225.15 | 38,326.93 | -18,101.78 | ~1.9x lower |

### Key Findings:

- **CPB1** (Carboxypeptidase B1) shows the most dramatic down-regulation, with expression levels ~11.5 times lower in TP53-mutated samples
- **SLC39A6** (Zinc transporter ZIP6) is the second most down-regulated gene
- These genes are consistently down-regulated across 347-348 TP53-mutated samples compared to 734-735 non-mutated samples

This analysis suggests that TP53 mutation status is associated with significant changes in gene expression patterns in breast cancer, particularly affecting genes involved in metabolism, zinc transport, extracellular matrix, ER stress response, and immune complement pathways.
