# Question 9

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** "What are the top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET for mutations, copy numbers and SVs combined?"

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET. Let me first search for the correct study identifier.



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "osteosarcoma TARGET"
}
```



Result from `list_studies`:
```json

```


Let me try a broader search:

```


Great! I found the study: **os_target_gdc** (Osteosarcoma from TARGET GDC, 2025). Let me get the study guide and then query for the top altered genes.



Calling `get_study_guide` with args:
```json
{
  "study_id": "os_target_gdc"
}
```



Result from `get_study_guide`:
```json
# Osteosarcoma (TARGET, 2018)

**Study ID:** `os_target_gdc`

## Overview
Pediatric osteosarcoma study from the TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) initiative. Whole exome sequencing data.

## Gene Panel
- **WES** (Whole Exome Sequencing): All coding genes profiled
- For mutation frequency calculations, you can use study-wide sample counts as the denominator (all genes equally covered)

## Clinical Attributes - Semantic Guide

### Patient Demographics
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `AGE` | Age at diagnosis | In years; pediatric population |
| `SEX` | Patient sex | Male, Female |
| `RACE` | Patient race | Per NIH categories |
| `ETHNICITY` | Patient ethnicity | Hispanic/Latino status |

### Disease Characteristics
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `DISEASE` | Disease type | Should be "Osteosarcoma" |
| `TUMOR_SITE` | Primary tumor location | e.g., Femur, Tibia |
| `HISTOLOGY` | Histological subtype | Osteoblastic, Chondroblastic, etc. |

### Clinical Outcomes
| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `OS_MONTHS` | Overall survival in months | Time from diagnosis |
| `OS_STATUS` | Overall survival status | 0:LIVING, 1:DECEASED |
| `EFS_MONTHS` | Event-free survival in months | Time to first event |
| `EFS_STATUS` | Event-free survival status | 0:No event, 1:Event |

### Treatment Response
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `PERCENT_NECROSIS` | Tumor necrosis percentage post-chemotherapy |
| `NECROSIS_GROUP` | Grouped necrosis response |

## Notes & Caveats
- This is a pediatric cancer cohort; age distribution is younger than adult studies
- WES coverage means no gene panel filtering needed for frequency calculations
- Part of TARGET consortium; integrated with other pediatric cancer data

Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json

Perfect! Here are the **top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025) study** combining mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), and structural variants (SVs):

## Top 5 Frequently Altered Genes

| Rank | Gene | Altered Samples | Alteration Frequency |
|------|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 38 | 24.4% |
| 2 | **LINC00901** | 32 | 20.5% |
| 3 | **TRIM16** | 31 | 19.9% |
| 4 | **MYO15A** | 31 | 19.9% |
| 5 | **RN7SL442P** | 31 | 19.9% |

### Key Findings:

- **TP53** is the most frequently altered gene, affected in ~24% of samples, which is consistent with its well-known role as a tumor suppressor in many cancers including osteosarcoma.

- The other top genes (LINC00901, TRIM16, MYO15A, RN7SL442P) show similar alteration frequencies around 20%.

- This analysis is based on 156 samples with genomic data in the study (whole exome sequencing).

Note: Some of the highly altered genes (like LINC00901 and RN7SL442P) are non-coding RNAs, which may reflect copy number alterations or structural variants affecting larger genomic regions rather than point mutations.
