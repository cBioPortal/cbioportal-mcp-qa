# Question 26

**Type:** Gene Panels

**Question:** What percentage of genomic events in the MSK-CHORD Study occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used)?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the percentage of genomic events that occur in off-panel genes in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me start by exploring the available data structure.

# MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)

**Study ID:** `msk_chord_2024`

## Overview
Targeted sequencing via MSK-IMPACT panels. Clinical annotations include some derived from natural language processing (denoted NLP).

## Gene Panels
This study uses multiple MSK-IMPACT panel versions:
- **IMPACT341**: Earlier version, 341 genes
- **IMPACT410**: 410 genes
- **IMPACT468**: 468 genes  
- **IMPACT505**: Latest version, 505 genes

**Important:** Different samples may have different gene coverage. Always use gene-specific denominators when calculating mutation frequencies.

| **Total** | **25,040** | All samples in study |

**🚨 CRITICAL:** To query primary/metastatic samples, use `clinical_data_derived` with `attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'`:
```sql
-- CORRECT way to count primary samples
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as primary_samples
FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
  AND attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'
  AND attribute_value = 'Primary';
-- Returns: 15,928

-- DO NOT use sample.sample_type column - it contains "Primary Solid Tumor" for ALL samples!
```

## Treatment Data

MSK-CHORD has **detailed treatment data** stored in clinical_event tables. This is one of the most comprehensive treatment datasets in cBioPortal.

### Treatment Event Keys

|-----|-------------|----------------|
| `AGENT` | Drug/treatment name | FLUOROURACIL, PEMBROLIZUMAB, OXALIPLATIN |
| `SUBTYPE` | Treatment category | Chemo, Immuno, Targeted, Hormone, Radiation Therapy |
| `RX_INVESTIGATIVE` | Investigational drug flag | Y, N |
| `FLAG_OROTOPICAL` | Oral/topical administration | 0, 1 |
| `TREATMENT_TYPE` | Broad treatment type | Medical Therapy |
| `PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK` | Prior medications flag | Indicates meds before MSK care |
| `INFERRED_TX_PROB` | NLP inference probability | Confidence score for NLP-extracted data |

### Treatment Subtypes

| Subtype | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| `Targeted` | Molecularly targeted agents (TKIs, etc.) |
| `Immuno` | Immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors, etc.) |
| `Hormone` | Hormonal therapy |
| `Radiation Therapy` | Radiation treatment |
| `Biologic` | Biologic agents |
| `Investigational` | Investigational/trial drugs |
| `Bone Treatment` | Bone-targeted agents (bisphosphonates, etc.) |
| `Prior Medications to MSK` | Medications before MSK treatment |

### Query Examples

```sql
-- Get treatments by subtype
SELECT 
    subtype.value as treatment_type,
    agent.value as agent,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ce.patient_id) as patients
FROM clinical_event ce
JOIN clinical_event_data agent ON ce.clinical_event_id = agent.clinical_event_id AND agent.key = 'AGENT'
JOIN clinical_event_data subtype ON ce.clinical_event_id = subtype.clinical_event_id AND subtype.key = 'SUBTYPE'
JOIN patient p ON ce.patient_id = p.internal_id
JOIN cancer_study cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id
WHERE cs.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
  AND ce.event_type IN ('Treatment', 'TREATMENT')
GROUP BY subtype.value, agent.value
ORDER BY treatment_type, patients DESC;
```

### Treatment Data Caveats
- Some treatment data is NLP-extracted (`INFERRED_TX_PROB` indicates confidence)
- `PRIOR_MED_TO_MSK` captures pre-MSK treatments separately
- Treatment timing (start_date, stop_date) is in days from diagnosis
- **Cannot calculate percentages**: We can't distinguish "not collected" from "not received"

### Treatment Query Patterns for MSK-CHORD

**For broad questions** ("What treatments did patients receive?"):
1. First summarize by SUBTYPE (Chemo, Immuno, Targeted, etc.)
2. Then list top agents within each category

**For specific questions** ("Most common treatment?"):
- Query by AGENT key
- Report patient count, NOT percentage
- Expected answer: Fluorouracil (~6,319 patients)

**For treatment type questions** ("Most common chemotherapy?"):
- Filter by `SUBTYPE = 'Chemo'` and report by AGENT

## Notes & Caveats
- Some clinical annotations are NLP-derived and may have extraction errors
- Multiple IMPACT panel versions mean gene coverage varies by sample
- Data is under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license; contact datarequests@mskcc.org for commercial use

Great! I can see there's a `genomic_event_derived` table that includes "off-panel detection to identify events in genes not covered by the associated gene panel." Let me examine this table more closely.

Perfect! The `genomic_event_derived` table has an `off_panel` column that indicates whether each genomic event occurred in a gene not covered by the sequencing panel. Now let me query the data to calculate the percentage of off-panel events in the MSK-CHORD study.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) as total_events,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN off_panel = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as off_panel_events,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN off_panel = false THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as on_panel_events,\n    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN off_panel = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as off_panel_percentage\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"total_events":279212,"off_panel_events":2849,"on_panel_events":276363,"off_panel_percentage":1.02}]}
```


Let me also break this down by variant type to provide more detailed insights:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    variant_type,\n    COUNT(*) as total_events,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN off_panel = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as off_panel_events,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN off_panel = false THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as on_panel_events,\n    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN off_panel = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as off_panel_percentage\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\nGROUP BY variant_type\nORDER BY total_events DESC\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"variant_type":"mutation","total_events":208214,"off_panel_events":150,"on_panel_events":208064,"off_panel_percentage":0.07},{"variant_type":"cna","total_events":60787,"off_panel_events":0,"on_panel_events":60787,"off_panel_percentage":0.0},{"variant_type":"structural_variant","total_events":10211,"off_panel_events":2699,"on_panel_events":7512,"off_panel_percentage":26.43}]}
```


Excellent! Now let me get some additional context about the most common off-panel genes:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    variant_type,\n    COUNT(*) as event_count,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as sample_count\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n  AND off_panel = true\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol, variant_type\nORDER BY event_count DESC\nLIMIT 20\n"
}
```

## Answer

In the MSK-CHORD study, **1.02%** of genomic events occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used).

### Breakdown by Variant Type:

| Variant Type | Total Events | Off-Panel Events | Off-Panel % |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Mutations** | 208,214 | 150 | 0.07% |
| **Copy Number Alterations (CNA)** | 60,787 | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Structural Variants** | 10,211 | 2,699 | **26.43%** |
| **Overall** | **279,212** | **2,849** | **1.02%** |

### Key Findings:

1. **Structural variants have the highest off-panel rate** at 26.43%, meaning more than 1 in 4 structural variants involve genes not covered by the MSK-IMPACT panels.

2. **Mutations are rarely off-panel** (0.07%), indicating the MSK-IMPACT panels effectively capture most point mutations and indels.

3. **No off-panel CNAs were detected**, suggesting copy number analysis is restricted to panel genes.

4. **Most common off-panel genes** are fusion partners in structural variants, including:
   - **EML4** (211 events) - commonly fused with ALK in lung cancer
   - **KIF5B** (91 events) - another ALK fusion partner
   - **CD74** (75 events) - ROS1 fusion partner
   - **RTEL1-TNFRSF6B** (137 mutation events)

This pattern makes biological sense: while the MSK-IMPACT panels are designed to capture mutations in cancer-related genes, structural variants (fusions) can involve partner genes that aren't necessarily cancer drivers themselves but are important for identifying actionable alterations.
