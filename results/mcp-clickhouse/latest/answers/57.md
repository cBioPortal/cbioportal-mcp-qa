# Question 57

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?

**Answer:**

I'll help you investigate the relationship between EML4-ALK fusion variants, quality of life, and secondary cancer risk in lung cancer patients. Let me start by exploring what data is available in the database.

Great! I can see there are EML4-ALK fusions in the data. Now let me check what clinical attributes are available related to quality of life and secondary cancers:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT DISTINCT attr_id, description, patient_attribute\nFROM clinical_attribute_meta\nWHERE cancer_study_id IN (\n    SELECT cancer_study_id \n    FROM cancer_study \n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier IN ('msk_chord_2024', 'lung_msk_2017', 'lung_nci_2022', 'msk_impact_2017', 'msk_met_2021')\n)\nAND (\n    LOWER(description) LIKE '%quality%' \n    OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%qol%'\n    OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%secondary%'\n    OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%second%cancer%'\n    OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%metasta%'\n    OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%survival%'\n    OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%outcome%'\n    OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%recurrence%'\n    OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%progression%'\n)\nORDER BY cancer_study_id, attr_id\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
