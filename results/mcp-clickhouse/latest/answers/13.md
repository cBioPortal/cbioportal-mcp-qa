# Question 13

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What percentage of patients in the MSK-CHORD Study have at least one TP53 mutation?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the percentage of patients in the MSK-CHORD study with at least one TP53 mutation.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH tp53_patients AS (\n  SELECT DISTINCT patient_unique_id\n  FROM genomic_event_derived\n  WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol = 'TP53'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n),\ntotal_patients AS (\n  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as total\n  FROM genomic_event_derived\n  WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n),\ntp53_count AS (\n  SELECT COUNT(*) as count_with_tp53\n  FROM tp53_patients\n)\nSELECT \n  tp53_count.count_with_tp53,\n  total_patients.total as total_patients,\n  ROUND((tp53_count.count_with_tp53 * 100.0) / total_patients.total, 2) as percentage_with_tp53\nFROM tp53_count, total_patients\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"count_with_tp53":13105,"total_patients":24209,"percentage_with_tp53":54.13}]}
```


Based on the MSK-CHORD study data, **54.13% of patients have at least one TP53 mutation**.

Specifically:
- **13,105 patients** have at least one TP53 mutation
- **24,209 total patients** in the study

This means that more than half of the patients in the MSK-CHORD study have a mutation in the TP53 gene, which is consistent with TP53 being one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer.
