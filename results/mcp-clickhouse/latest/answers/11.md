# Question 11

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me query the genomic data.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as num_samples_mutated,\n    COUNT(*) as total_mutations\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND hugo_gene_symbol != ''\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY num_samples_mutated DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TP53","num_samples_mutated":13124,"total_mutations":13876},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"KRAS","num_samples_mutated":7128,"total_mutations":7231},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"APC","num_samples_mutated":4777,"total_mutations":7187},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"PIK3CA","num_samples_mutated":3708,"total_mutations":4178},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"EGFR","num_samples_mutated":2159,"total_mutations":2556}]}
```


Based on the MSK-CHORD study data, here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes**:

1. **TP53** - Mutated in 13,124 samples (13,876 total mutations)
2. **KRAS** - Mutated in 7,128 samples (7,231 total mutations)
3. **APC** - Mutated in 4,777 samples (7,187 total mutations)
4. **PIK3CA** - Mutated in 3,708 samples (4,178 total mutations)
5. **EGFR** - Mutated in 2,159 samples (2,556 total mutations)

**Key observations:**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, which is consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor gene commonly altered across many cancer types
- **KRAS** is the second most common, often mutated in colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers
- **APC** shows a notable difference between samples mutated (4,777) and total mutations (7,187), suggesting some samples have multiple APC mutations
- These genes are well-known cancer drivers involved in cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and growth control
