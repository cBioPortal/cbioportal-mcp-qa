# Question 46

**Type:** Pan-Cancer BRAF Analysis

**Question:** Which cancer types show the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find which cancer types show the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations across TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies.

Let me start by exploring the available data structure and then query for this specific mutation across cancer types.



Calling `list_studies` with args:
```json
{
  "search": "pan_can_atlas",
  "limit": 50
}
```

```


Now let me query for BRAF V600E mutations across all these TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies. I'll use the genomic_event_derived table to find samples with this specific mutation.



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH tcga_studies AS (\n    SELECT cancer_study_id, cancer_study_identifier, name\n    FROM cancer_study\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier LIKE '%_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018'\n),\nbraf_v600e_samples AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT\n        cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n        cs.name as study_name,\n        ged.sample_unique_id\n    FROM genomic_event_derived ged\n    JOIN tcga_studies cs ON ged.cancer_study_identifier = cs.cancer_study_identifier\n    WHERE ged.hugo_gene_symbol = 'BRAF'\n        AND ged.variant_type = 'mutation'\n        AND ged.protein_change = 'V600E'\n),\ntotal_samples AS (\n    SELECT \n        cs.cancer_study_identifier,\n        cs.name as study_name,\n        COUNT(DISTINCT s.sample_unique_id) as total_samples\n    FROM sample s\n    JOIN patient p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id\n    JOIN tcga_studies cs ON p.cancer_study_id = cs.cancer_study_id\n    GROUP BY cs.cancer_study_identifier, cs.name\n)\nSELECT \n    ts.study_name,\n    ts.cancer_study_identifier,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT bv.sample_unique_id) as braf_v600e_count,\n    ts.total_samples,\n    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT bv.sample_unique_id) * 100.0) / ts.total_samples, 2) as frequency_percent\nFROM total_samples ts\nLEFT JOIN braf_v600e_samples bv ON ts.cancer_study_identifier = bv.cancer_study_identifier\nGROUP BY ts.study_name, ts.cancer_study_identifier, ts.total_samples\nHAVING braf_v600e_count > 0\nORDER BY frequency_percent DESC\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"error_message":"Query execution failed: Received ClickHouse exception, code: 47, server response: Code: 47. DB::Exception: Identifier 's.sample_unique_id' cannot be resolved from table with name s.

```


Let me check the sample table structure:



Calling `clickhouse_list_table_columns` with args:
```json
{
  "table": "sample"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_list_table_columns`:
```json
{"columns":[{"name":"internal_id","type":"Nullable(Int64)","comment":"Primary key.

```


I see - the sample table uses `stable_id` not `sample_unique_id`. Let me revise the query:

```json

I see - the column is `mutation_variant` not `protein_change`. Let me update the query:

Perfect! Now let me get a bit more detail to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me also check if there are any other cancer types with BRAF V600E that might have been missed:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json

}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide you with a detailed answer:

Based on analysis of all 32 TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, here are the cancer types showing the **highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations**:

### Top 10 Cancer Types by BRAF V600E Frequency:

| Rank | Cancer Type | Study | V600E Cases | Total Samples | Frequency |
|------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Thyroid Carcinoma** | THCA | 284 | 500 | **56.8%** |
| 2 | **Skin Cutaneous Melanoma** | SKCM | 158 | 448 | **35.3%** |
| 3 | **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma** | COADREAD | 48 | 594 | **8.1%** |
| 4 | Cholangiocarcinoma | CHOL | 1 | 36 | 2.8% |
| 5 | Lung Adenocarcinoma | LUAD | 9 | 566 | 1.6% |
| 6 | Glioblastoma Multiforme | GBM | 5 | 592 | 0.8% |
| 7 | Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma | KIRP | 2 | 283 | 0.7% |
| 8 | Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma | BLCA | 1 | 411 | 0.2% |
| 9 | Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma | HNSC | 1 | 523 | 0.2% |
| 10 | Brain Lower Grade Glioma | LGG | 1 | 514 | 0.2% |

### Key Findings:

1. **Thyroid Carcinoma** shows by far the highest frequency at **56.8%** - more than half of all thyroid cancer samples harbor the BRAF V600E mutation.

2. **Melanoma** is the second most common at **35.3%**, which is consistent with the well-established role of BRAF V600E in melanoma pathogenesis.

3. **Colorectal Cancer** shows a notable frequency of **8.1%**, representing a clinically significant subset of patients.

4. The remaining cancer types show very low frequencies (<3%), with most having only sporadic cases.

5. **Total across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies**: 510 samples with BRAF V600E mutations out of approximately 10,000+ total samples.

### Additional Context:
- BRAF V600E is the most common BRAF mutation at codon 600, accounting for 510 cases
- Other V600 variants are much rarer: V600K (35 cases), V600R (4 cases)
- The mutation is particularly actionable in melanoma and thyroid cancer, where BRAF inhibitors are FDA-approved therapies
