# Question 65

**Type:** Stratified Mutation Burden Analysis

**Question:** What is the average tumor mutational burden of breast cancer patients who have at least two of the five most frequently mutated genes and how does this compare to the average TMB of all patients?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the average TMB for breast cancer patients with at least two of the five most frequently mutated genes, and compare it to the overall average TMB.

Let me break this down into steps:
1. First, identify the 5 most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer patients
2. Find patients with at least 2 of these genes mutated
3. Calculate their average TMB
4. Compare to the overall average TMB



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Step 1: Find the 5 most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer patients\nSELECT \n    hugo_gene_symbol,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as mutation_count\nFROM genomic_event_derived\nWHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND sample_unique_id IN (\n        SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n        FROM clinical_data_derived\n        WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n            AND attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n            AND attribute_value = 'Breast Cancer'\n    )\nGROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol\nORDER BY mutation_count DESC\nLIMIT 5\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"hugo_gene_symbol":"TP53","mutation_count":2138},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"PIK3CA","mutation_count":1908},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"GATA3","mutation_count":796},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"CDH1","mutation_count":699},{"hugo_gene_symbol":"KMT2C","mutation_count":432}]}
```


Great! The 5 most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer patients are: TP53, PIK3CA, GATA3, CDH1, and KMT2C.

Now let me find patients with at least 2 of these genes mutated and calculate their average TMB:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Step 2 & 3: Find breast cancer patients with at least 2 of the top 5 genes mutated and their average TMB\nWITH top_genes AS (\n    SELECT sample_unique_id, patient_unique_id\n    FROM genomic_event_derived\n    WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n        AND variant_type = 'mutation'\n        AND hugo_gene_symbol IN ('TP53', 'PIK3CA', 'GATA3', 'CDH1', 'KMT2C')\n        AND sample_unique_id IN (\n            SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n            FROM clinical_data_derived\n            WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n                AND attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n                AND attribute_value = 'Breast Cancer'\n        )\n    GROUP BY sample_unique_id, patient_unique_id, hugo_gene_symbol\n),\npatients_with_multiple_mutations AS (\n    SELECT \n        patient_unique_id,\n        COUNT(DISTINCT hugo_gene_symbol) as gene_count\n    FROM (\n        SELECT DISTINCT \n            g.patient_unique_id,\n            g.hugo_gene_symbol\n        FROM genomic_event_derived g\n        WHERE g.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n            AND g.variant_type = 'mutation'\n            AND g.hugo_gene_symbol IN ('TP53', 'PIK3CA', 'GATA3', 'CDH1', 'KMT2C')\n            AND g.sample_unique_id IN (\n                SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n                FROM clinical_data_derived\n                WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n                    AND attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n                    AND attribute_value = 'Breast Cancer'\n            )\n    )\n    GROUP BY patient_unique_id\n    HAVING gene_count >= 2\n)\nSELECT \n    AVG(toFloat64(cd.attribute_value)) as avg_tmb,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT cd.patient_unique_id) as patient_count\nFROM clinical_data_derived cd\nINNER JOIN patients_with_multiple_mutations pm ON cd.patient_unique_id = pm.patient_unique_id\nWHERE cd.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND cd.attribute_name = 'TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS'\n    AND cd.attribute_value != 'NA'\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"avg_tmb":6.79935253613257,"patient_count":1476}]}
```


Now let me get the average TMB for all breast cancer patients:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\n-- Step 4: Calculate average TMB for all breast cancer patients\nSELECT \n    AVG(toFloat64(cd.attribute_value)) as avg_tmb_all,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT cd.patient_unique_id) as total_patient_count\nFROM clinical_data_derived cd\nWHERE cd.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND cd.attribute_name = 'TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS'\n    AND cd.attribute_value != 'NA'\n    AND cd.patient_unique_id IN (\n        SELECT DISTINCT patient_unique_id\n        FROM clinical_data_derived\n        WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n            AND attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n            AND attribute_value = 'Breast Cancer'\n    )\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json
{"rows":[{"avg_tmb_all":4.269597838083263,"total_patient_count":5368}]}
```


Perfect! Now let me provide you with a comprehensive answer:

## Results Summary

### The 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in Breast Cancer:
1. **TP53** - 2,138 samples
2. **PIK3CA** - 1,908 samples
3. **GATA3** - 796 samples
4. **CDH1** - 699 samples
5. **KMT2C** - 432 samples

### Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) Comparison:

**Patients with ≥2 of the top 5 mutated genes:**
- Average TMB: **6.80 mutations/Mb**
- Number of patients: 1,476

**All breast cancer patients:**
- Average TMB: **4.27 mutations/Mb**
- Number of patients: 5,368

### Key Finding:
Breast cancer patients who have mutations in at least two of the five most frequently mutated genes have an **average TMB that is 59% higher** (6.80 vs 4.27 mutations/Mb) compared to all breast cancer patients. This suggests that patients with multiple mutations in these commonly altered genes tend to have a higher overall mutational burden, which could have implications for treatment strategies, particularly immunotherapy eligibility.
