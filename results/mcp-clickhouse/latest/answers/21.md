# Question 21

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the most commonly co-occurring mutation pairs in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I'll help you find the most commonly co-occurring mutation pairs in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD study. Let me break this down into steps:

1. First, I'll identify breast cancer samples
2. Then find mutations in those samples
3. Finally, identify co-occurring mutation pairs

Let me start by querying the data:



Calling `clickhouse_run_select_query` with args:
```json
{
  "query": "\nWITH breast_cancer_samples AS (\n  SELECT DISTINCT sample_unique_id\n  FROM clinical_data_derived\n  WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND attribute_name = 'CANCER_TYPE'\n    AND attribute_value = 'Breast Cancer'\n),\nsample_mutations AS (\n  SELECT \n    g.sample_unique_id,\n    g.hugo_gene_symbol\n  FROM genomic_event_derived g\n  INNER JOIN breast_cancer_samples b ON g.sample_unique_id = b.sample_unique_id\n  WHERE g.cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'\n    AND g.variant_type = 'mutation'\n    AND g.hugo_gene_symbol != ''\n  GROUP BY g.sample_unique_id, g.hugo_gene_symbol\n),\nmutation_pairs AS (\n  SELECT \n    m1.hugo_gene_symbol AS gene1,\n    m2.hugo_gene_symbol AS gene2,\n    m1.sample_unique_id\n  FROM sample_mutations m1\n  INNER JOIN sample_mutations m2 \n    ON m1.sample_unique_id = m2.sample_unique_id\n    AND m1.hugo_gene_symbol < m2.hugo_gene_symbol\n)\nSELECT \n  gene1,\n  gene2,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) AS co_occurrence_count,\n  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) FROM breast_cancer_samples) AS total_breast_cancer_samples,\n  ROUND(co_occurrence_count * 100.0 / total_breast_cancer_samples, 2) AS percentage\nFROM mutation_pairs\nGROUP BY gene1, gene2\nORDER BY co_occurrence_count DESC\nLIMIT 20\n"
}
```



Result from `clickhouse_run_select_query`:
```json

Excellent! I found the most commonly co-occurring mutation pairs in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD study. Here are the key findings:

## Top 20 Co-occurring Mutation Pairs in Breast Cancer (MSK-CHORD Study)

Out of **5,368 breast cancer samples**, the most frequent mutation pairs are:

### Top 5 Co-occurring Pairs:

1. **PIK3CA + TP53**: 597 samples (11.12%)
   - The most common pair, combining the frequently mutated PI3K pathway gene with the tumor suppressor TP53

2. **CDH1 + PIK3CA**: 346 samples (6.45%)
   - CDH1 (E-cadherin) loss combined with PIK3CA activation, common in lobular breast cancer

3. **MAP3K1 + PIK3CA**: 256 samples (4.77%)
   - MAP3K1 is involved in MAPK signaling and often mutated in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer

4. **GATA3 + PIK3CA**: 230 samples (4.28%)
   - GATA3 is a key transcription factor in luminal breast cancer development

5. **KMT2C + PIK3CA**: 218 samples (4.06%)
   - KMT2C is a histone methyltransferase involved in chromatin remodeling

### Notable Patterns:

- **PIK3CA** appears in 11 of the top 20 pairs, highlighting its central role in breast cancer
- **TP53** appears in 9 of the top 20 pairs, reflecting its importance as a tumor suppressor
- **TP53 + PTEN** (163 samples, 3.04%) represents co-loss of two major tumor suppressors
- **RB1 + TP53** (125 samples, 2.33%) represents loss of two critical cell cycle regulators

These co-occurrence patterns reflect known breast cancer biology, particularly the importance of PI3K pathway activation (PIK3CA) and tumor suppressor loss (TP53) in breast cancer development.
