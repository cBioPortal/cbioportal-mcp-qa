# Question 22

**Type:** Survival Analysis

**Question:** Do patients with PIK3CA mutations have different overall survival outcomes compared to PIK3CA wild-type patients in breast cancer from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me create a summary of the findings:

## Analysis: PIK3CA Mutations and Overall Survival in Breast Cancer (MSK-CHORD Study)

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD study data, here are the key findings regarding overall survival outcomes for PIK3CA mutated vs wild-type breast cancer patients:

### **Overall Survival Comparison**

| Metric | PIK3CA Mutant | PIK3CA Wild-type | Difference |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| **Total Patients** | 1,908 (35.5%) | 3,460 (64.5%) | - |
| **Median OS (months)** | 37.79 | 35.47 | +2.32 months |
| **Mean OS (months)** | 40.87 ± 27.13 | 39.68 ± 27.16 | +1.19 months |
| **Q1-Q3 (IQR)** | 16.50 - 64.29 | 15.58 - 62.34 | - |
| **Range** | 0.03 - 113.13 | 0.03 - 118.45 | - |
| **Deaths (events)** | 718 (37.63%) | 1,272 (36.76%) | +0.87% |
| **Living (censored)** | 1,190 (62.37%) | 2,188 (63.24%) | - |

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Slightly Better Survival in PIK3CA Mutant Patients**: Patients with PIK3CA mutations show a modest improvement in overall survival:
   - Median OS: 2.3 months longer (37.79 vs 35.47 months)
   - Mean OS: 1.2 months longer (40.87 vs 39.68 months)

2. **Similar Event Rates**: The death rates are very similar between groups (37.63% vs 36.76%), suggesting comparable outcomes overall.

3. **Similar Variability**: Both groups show similar standard deviations (~27 months) and interquartile ranges, indicating comparable survival distributions.

### **PIK3CA Mutation Characteristics:**

**Most Common PIK3CA Mutations in Breast Cancer:**
- H1047R (709 patients) - hotspot in kinase domain
- E545K (414 patients) - hotspot in helical domain
- E542K (218 patients) - hotspot in helical domain
- N345K (122 patients)
- H1047L (89 patients)

**PIK3CA Mutation Rates by Breast Cancer Subtype:**
- Breast Invasive Lobular Carcinoma: **50.0%** (269/538)
- Breast Mixed Ductal and Lobular: **50.0%** (43/86)
- Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: **34.7%** (1,163/3,350)
- Invasive Breast Carcinoma: **31.4%** (304/967)
- Metaplastic Breast Cancer: **29.0%** (9/31)

### **Clinical Interpretation:**

The data suggests that **PIK3CA mutations are associated with slightly better overall survival** in breast cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD cohort, though the difference is modest (approximately 2-3 months in median OS). This finding is consistent with some published literature suggesting that PIK3CA mutations, particularly in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, may be associated with:

1. Less aggressive disease biology
2. Better response to endocrine therapy
3. Potential benefit from PI3K inhibitors (e.g., alpelisib)

However, the small magnitude of the difference and similar event rates suggest that PIK3CA mutation status alone may not be a strong prognostic factor, though it remains an important predictive biomarker for targeted therapy selection.

**Note**: This is an observational analysis and does not account for potential confounding factors such as treatment received, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, stage at diagnosis, or other clinical variables that could influence survival outcomes.
