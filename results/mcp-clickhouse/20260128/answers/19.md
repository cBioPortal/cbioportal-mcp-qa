# Question 19

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 10 most frequently mutated genes across all cancer types in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Here are the **top 10 most frequently mutated genes** in the MSK-CHORD Study:

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Samples with Mutation | Total Mutations |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 13,124 | 13,876 |
| 2 | **KRAS** | 7,128 | 7,231 |
| 3 | **APC** | 4,777 | 7,187 |
| 4 | **PIK3CA** | 3,708 | 4,178 |
| 5 | **EGFR** | 2,159 | 2,556 |
| 6 | **ARID1A** | 1,843 | 2,205 |
| 7 | **SMAD4** | 1,796 | 1,925 |
| 8 | **KMT2D** | 1,783 | 2,390 |
| 9 | **KMT2C** | 1,629 | 1,979 |
| 10 | **ATM** | 1,388 | 1,681 |

**Key Findings:**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in over 13,000 samples
- **KRAS** is the second most common, present in over 7,000 samples
- **APC** shows the highest ratio of total mutations to mutated samples (7,187 mutations in 4,777 samples), suggesting multiple mutations per sample in some cases
- The list includes well-known cancer driver genes involved in cell cycle regulation (TP53), signaling pathways (KRAS, PIK3CA, EGFR), chromatin modification (KMT2D, KMT2C, ARID1A), and DNA repair (ATM)
