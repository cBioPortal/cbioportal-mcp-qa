# Question 5

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about treatments in the MSK-CHORD study. Let me provide a complete answer:

## Treatment Data from MSK-CHORD Study

Based on the clinical event data from the **MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)** study, which includes **24,950 patients**, the most commonly received treatments were:

### Top 10 Most Common Treatment Agents:

1. **FLUOROURACIL** - 6,319 patients (25.3%)
2. **LEUCOVORIN** - 5,573 patients (22.3%)
3. **OXALIPLATIN** - 5,489 patients (22.0%)
4. **CAPECITABINE** - 4,808 patients (19.3%)
5. **CARBOPLATIN** - 4,604 patients (18.5%)
6. **IRINOTECAN** - 4,329 patients (17.3%)
7. **INVESTIGATIONAL** - 4,114 patients (16.5%)
8. **GEMCITABINE** - 4,038 patients (16.2%)
9. **LEUPROLIDE** - 3,708 patients (14.9%)
10. **PACLITAXEL** - 3,679 patients (14.7%)

### Key Findings:

- **Fluorouracil (5-FU)** was the most commonly administered treatment, received by over 6,300 patients
- The top three agents (Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin) are commonly used together in **FOLFOX** chemotherapy regimens, particularly for colorectal cancer
- The presence of multiple chemotherapy agents reflects the diverse cancer types included in this large pan-cancer study
- Targeted therapies and immunotherapies (like Pembrolizumab, #18 with 2,061 patients) are also represented in the treatment landscape

This data reflects the real-world treatment patterns at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for patients who underwent genomic profiling.
