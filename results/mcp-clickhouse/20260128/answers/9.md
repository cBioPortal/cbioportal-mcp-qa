# Question 9

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** "What are the top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET for mutations, copy numbers and SVs combined?"

**Answer:**

Perfect! Here are the **top 5 frequently altered genes in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study** (combining mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants):

## Top 5 Frequently Altered Genes

| Rank | Gene | Samples Altered | Frequency | Mutations | CNAs | SVs | Total Alterations |
|------|------|----------------|-----------|-----------|------|-----|-------------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 38 | 23.9% | 33 | 6 | 0 | 39 |
| 2 | **LINC00901** | 32 | 20.1% | 0 | 32 | 0 | 32 |
| 3 | **TRIM16** | 31 | 19.5% | 1 | 30 | 0 | 31 |
| 4 | **MYO15A** | 31 | 19.5% | 2 | 30 | 0 | 32 |
| 5 | **RN7SL442P** | 31 | 19.5% | 0 | 31 | 0 | 31 |

**Study Context:** TARGET Osteosarcoma (GDC, 2025) with 159 total samples

### Key Findings:

1. **TP53** is the most frequently altered gene (38/159 samples, 23.9%), predominantly through mutations (33 events) with some copy number alterations (6 events). This is consistent with TP53's well-known role as a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in osteosarcoma.

2. The remaining top 4 genes (LINC00901, TRIM16, MYO15A, RN7SL442P) are primarily altered through **copy number alterations** rather than mutations, each affecting approximately 20% of samples.

3. No structural variants were detected in the top 5 genes, suggesting that mutations and CNAs are the dominant alteration types in this cohort.
