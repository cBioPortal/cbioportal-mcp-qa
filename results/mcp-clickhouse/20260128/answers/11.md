**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

## Top 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in MSK-CHORD Study

Here are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study (msk_chord_2024):

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Samples with Mutation | Total Mutations |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 13,124 | 13,876 |
| 2 | **KRAS** | 7,128 | 7,231 |
| 3 | **APC** | 4,777 | 7,187 |
| 4 | **PIK3CA** | 3,708 | 4,178 |
| 5 | **EGFR** | 2,159 | 2,556 |

**Key Findings:**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in over 13,000 samples
- **KRAS** is the second most common, present in over 7,000 samples
- **APC** shows a notable difference between mutated samples (4,777) and total mutations (7,187), indicating some samples have multiple APC mutations
- These genes are well-known cancer drivers frequently altered across various cancer types
