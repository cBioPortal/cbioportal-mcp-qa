# Question 10

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What is the median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study?

**Answer:**

## Answer

Based on the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), the **median age at diagnosis is approximately 15.2 years**.

Here are the detailed statistics:

- **Median age**: 15.2 years
- **First quartile (Q1)**: 12.2 years  
- **Third quartile (Q3)**: 17.7 years
- **Minimum age**: 3.6 years
- **Maximum age**: 87.1 years
- **Patients with age data**: 293 out of 383 total patients (76.5%)

This median age of ~15 years is consistent with the known epidemiology of osteosarcoma, which is the most common primary bone cancer in children and adolescents, with peak incidence during the adolescent growth spurt. The interquartile range (12.2 to 17.7 years) shows that the majority of patients in this pediatric study were diagnosed during their teenage years.
