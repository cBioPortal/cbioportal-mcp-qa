## Answer

In the **MSK-CHORD Study (msk_chord_2024)**, there are **26 unique patients** who have both primary and metastatic samples.

### Additional Context:
- The study contains a total of:
  - 15,928 Primary samples
  - 8,878 Metastasis samples
  - 136 Unknown samples
  - 98 Local Recurrence samples

- All 26 patients with both sample types have exactly 1 primary sample and 1 metastatic sample each (2 samples total per patient)

This represents a relatively small subset of patients where both the primary tumor and metastatic site were sampled and sequenced, which is valuable for studying tumor evolution and metastatic progression.
