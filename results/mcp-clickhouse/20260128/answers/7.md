# Question 7

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently copy number altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Here are the **top 5 most frequently copy number altered genes** in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study:

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Samples Altered | Frequency |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | **LINC00901** | 32 | 39.5% |
| 2 | **RN7SL442P** | 31 | 38.3% |
| 3 | **UBB** | 30 | 37.0% |
| 4 | **DRC3** | 30 | 37.0% |
| 5 | **TBC1D26-AS1** | 30 | 37.0% |

**Context:**
- Total samples with CNA data: 81
- Study: Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)

**Notes:**
- **LINC00901** is a long intergenic non-protein coding RNA
- **RN7SL442P** is a pseudogene
- **UBB** (Ubiquitin B) is a protein-coding gene involved in ubiquitination
- **DRC3** (Dynein Regulatory Complex Subunit 3) is involved in ciliary function
- **TBC1D26-AS1** is an antisense RNA

The relatively high frequency of copy number alterations in these genes (around 37-40% of samples) suggests they may be located in genomic regions that are frequently amplified or deleted in osteosarcoma.
