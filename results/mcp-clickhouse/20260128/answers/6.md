**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

## Top 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in TARGET Osteosarcoma Study

Based on the **Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025)** study with 141 samples, here are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes:

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Samples Mutated | Mutation Frequency | Total Mutations |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 32 | 22.7% | 33 |
| 2 | **MUC16** | 16 | 11.3% | 17 |
| 3 | **TTN** | 16 | 11.3% | 18 |
| 4 | **ATRX** | 11 | 7.8% | 11 |
| 5 | **DNAH9** | 10 | 7.1% | 10 |

### Key Findings:

- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in nearly 23% of osteosarcoma samples, which is consistent with its well-known role as a tumor suppressor in many cancers including osteosarcoma.

- **MUC16** and **TTN** are tied for second place, each mutated in 11.3% of samples. These are large genes often found mutated across cancer types, though their functional significance varies.

- **ATRX** mutations (7.8%) are notable as ATRX is involved in chromatin remodeling and telomere maintenance, and its alterations have been associated with various cancers.

- **DNAH9** rounds out the top 5 with mutations in 7.1% of samples.
