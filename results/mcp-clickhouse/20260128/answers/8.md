# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently altered genes in a structural variant in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

## Answer

Unfortunately, **there are no structural variant data available in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study** (os_target_gdc). 

The TARGET Osteosarcoma (TARGET GDC, 2025) study contains the following types of molecular data:
- **Mutations** (from whole exome sequencing)
- **Copy number alterations** (from GISTIC)
- **mRNA expression** (RNA-Seq data in various formats: TPM, FPKM, read counts, and z-scores)

But it does not include structural variant data (such as gene fusions or translocations). In fact, none of the TARGET studies in the database appear to have structural variant data available.

If you're interested in the most frequently **mutated** genes or genes with **copy number alterations** in this osteosarcoma study, I'd be happy to provide that information instead.
