# Question 14

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** Which cancer type has the highest average tumor mutational burden across all studies?

**Answer:**

Perfect! I have comprehensive results. Let me provide a clear answer to the user's question.

## Answer

Based on the analysis of tumor mutational burden (TMB) data across all studies in cBioPortal, **Skin Cancer, Non-Melanoma** has the highest average tumor mutational burden.

### Top 10 Cancer Types by Average TMB:

| Rank | Cancer Type | Sample Count | Average TMB | Median TMB |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | **Skin Cancer, Non-Melanoma** | 809 | **41.73** | 30.0 |
| 2 | Uterine Endometrioid Carcinoma | 271 | 19.12 | 2.3 |
| 3 | Endometrial Carcinoma | 95 | 18.27 | 1.8 |
| 4 | Breast Cancer, NOS | 95 | 15.76 | 5.87 |
| 5 | Melanoma | 4,984 | 15.28 | 6.85 |
| 6 | Endometrial Cancer | 5,342 | 15.25 | 4.32 |
| 7 | T-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma | 109 | 14.74 | 4.7 |
| 8 | Colon Adenocarcinoma | 136 | 14.01 | 4.1 |
| 9 | Colorectal Cancer | 17,858 | 12.76 | 5.74 |
| 10 | Bladder Cancer | 7,662 | 11.95 | 6.97 |

### Key Findings:

- **Skin Cancer, Non-Melanoma** leads with an average TMB of **41.73 mutations/Mb**, significantly higher than other cancer types
- This includes cancers like basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are heavily associated with UV radiation exposure
- **Melanoma** ranks 5th with an average TMB of 15.28, also reflecting UV-induced mutagenesis
- **Endometrial cancers** (various subtypes) show high TMB, often associated with microsatellite instability
- **Colorectal and bladder cancers** also demonstrate elevated TMB, consistent with their known immunotherapy responsiveness

The analysis included 252,213 samples with TMB data (using the TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS attribute) and only cancer types with at least 50 samples to ensure statistical reliability.
