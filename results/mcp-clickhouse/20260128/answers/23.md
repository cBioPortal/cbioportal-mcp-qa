# Question 23

**Type:** Clinical Data Correlation Analysis

**Question:** What is the correlation between tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability status in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive summary of the findings:

## Correlation Between TMB and MSI Status in Colorectal Cancer (MSK-CHORD Study)

### Summary Statistics

**Study Population:**
- Total colorectal cancer samples analyzed: **5,268**
- MSI-High (Instable): **586 samples (11.1%)**
- MSI-Stable: **4,682 samples (88.9%)**

### Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) by MSI Status

| MSI Status | Sample Count | Mean TMB | Median TMB | Min TMB | Max TMB | Std Dev |
|------------|--------------|----------|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **MSI-High (Instable)** | 586 | **64.63** | 56.68 | 0.0 | 490.57 | 42.15 |
| **MSI-Stable** | 4,682 | **7.58** | 5.87 | 0.0 | 570.96 | 20.23 |

### TMB Distribution by Category

**MSI-High (Instable) Samples:**
- High TMB (≥20): **574 samples (97.95%)**
- Intermediate TMB (10-20): 8 samples (1.37%)
- Low TMB (<10): 4 samples (0.68%)

**MSI-Stable Samples:**
- Low TMB (<10): **4,325 samples (92.38%)**
- Intermediate TMB (10-20): 304 samples (6.49%)
- High TMB (≥20): 53 samples (1.13%)

### Correlation Analysis

**Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.604**

This indicates a **strong positive correlation** between microsatellite instability status and tumor mutational burden in colorectal cancer patients.

### Key Findings

1. **MSI-High tumors have dramatically elevated TMB**: MSI-High tumors show a mean TMB that is **8.5 times higher** than MSI-Stable tumors (64.63 vs 7.58 mutations/Mb).

2. **Clear separation between groups**: Nearly 98% of MSI-High tumors have TMB ≥20, while over 92% of MSI-Stable tumors have TMB <10.

3. **Strong predictive relationship**: The correlation coefficient of 0.604 demonstrates that MSI status is a strong predictor of TMB in colorectal cancer.

4. **Clinical implications**: This strong correlation supports the use of either MSI testing or TMB assessment for identifying colorectal cancer patients who may benefit from immunotherapy, as both high MSI and high TMB are associated with better responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

### MSI Score Validation

The MSI scores further validate the classification:
- MSI-High: Mean MSI score = 29.33 (range: 9.99-53.53)
- MSI-Stable: Mean MSI score = 0.62 (range: 0.0-9.9)

This analysis from the MSK-CHORD study (25,040 tumors from 24,950 patients) provides robust evidence for the strong association between microsatellite instability and elevated tumor mutational burden in colorectal cancer.
