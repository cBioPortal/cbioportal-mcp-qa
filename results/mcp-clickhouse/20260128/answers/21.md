## Most Commonly Co-occurring Mutation Pairs in Breast Cancer (MSK-CHORD Study)

Based on analysis of **5,368 breast cancer samples** from the MSK-CHORD Study (MSK, Nature 2024), here are the **top 20 most commonly co-occurring mutation pairs**:

| Rank | Gene 1 | Gene 2 | Co-occurrence Count | % of Samples |
|------|--------|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| 1 | **PIK3CA** | **TP53** | 597 | 11.1% |
| 2 | **CDH1** | **PIK3CA** | 346 | 6.4% |
| 3 | **MAP3K1** | **PIK3CA** | 256 | 4.8% |
| 4 | **GATA3** | **PIK3CA** | 230 | 4.3% |
| 5 | **KMT2C** | **PIK3CA** | 218 | 4.1% |
| 6 | **PTEN** | **TP53** | 163 | 3.0% |
| 7 | **KMT2C** | **TP53** | 148 | 2.8% |
| 8 | **PIK3CA** | **TBX3** | 138 | 2.6% |
| 9 | **NF1** | **TP53** | 135 | 2.5% |
| 10 | **ESR1** | **PIK3CA** | 129 | 2.4% |
| 11 | **CBFB** | **PIK3CA** | 129 | 2.4% |
| 12 | **ARID1A** | **PIK3CA** | 126 | 2.3% |
| 13 | **CDH1** | **TP53** | 126 | 2.3% |
| 14 | **RB1** | **TP53** | 125 | 2.3% |
| 15 | **CDH1** | **TBX3** | 124 | 2.3% |
| 16 | **FOXA1** | **PIK3CA** | 121 | 2.3% |
| 17 | **GATA3** | **TP53** | 111 | 2.1% |
| 18 | **NF1** | **PIK3CA** | 110 | 2.0% |
| 19 | **KMT2D** | **TP53** | 107 | 2.0% |
| 20 | **MAP3K1** | **TP53** | 105 | 2.0% |

### Key Findings:

1. **PIK3CA-TP53** is by far the most common co-occurring pair (597 samples, 11.1%), representing mutations in the PI3K pathway and the tumor suppressor TP53.

2. **PIK3CA dominates** the co-occurrence landscape, appearing in 11 of the top 20 pairs. PIK3CA is mutated in 1,908 samples (35.5% of breast cancer samples).

3. **TP53 is the second most frequent partner**, appearing in 8 of the top 20 pairs. TP53 is mutated in 2,138 samples (39.8% of breast cancer samples).

4. **Hormone receptor-related genes** like ESR1, GATA3, and FOXA1 frequently co-occur with PIK3CA, reflecting the biology of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

5. **CDH1** (E-cadherin) shows strong co-occurrence with PIK3CA (346 samples), which is characteristic of lobular breast cancer.

These co-occurrence patterns reflect the molecular subtypes and key signaling pathways in breast cancer biology.
