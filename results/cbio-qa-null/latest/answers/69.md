# Question 69

**Type:** Identify Patients Molecularly

**Question:** Which patients have a TP53 G199V mutation? Which are somatic vs germline?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the specific patient data in your cBioPortal instance to identify which patients have a TP53 G199V mutation or their somatic vs germline status.

To find this information in cBioPortal, you can:

1. **Use the Mutations tab**: 
   - Navigate to your study of interest
   - Go to the "Mutations" tab
   - Filter for TP53 gene
   - Look for the G199V mutation (this is a missense mutation at position 199 where Glycine is changed to Valine)

2. **Check mutation details**:
   - Click on the specific mutation to see which samples/patients carry it
   - The mutation table typically includes a column indicating mutation type (somatic, germline, or unknown)

3. **Use OQL (Onco Query Language)**:
   - You can query: `TP53: MUT = G199V`

4. **Download mutation data**:
   - Download the mutations file which will include patient IDs and mutation status columns

The germline vs somatic designation depends on whether this information was included in the data loaded into your cBioPortal instance. Some studies may not have germline status annotated.

Would you like guidance on how to perform any of these specific searches in cBioPortal?
