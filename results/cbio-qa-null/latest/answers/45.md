# Question 45

**Type:** Subtype-specific Alterations

**Question:** What are the most frequently mutated genes in copy-number high subtype endometrial cancers compared to other subtypes?

**Answer:**

Based on the cBioPortal data for endometrial cancer, the **copy-number high (CN-high) subtype** shows distinct mutation patterns compared to other molecular subtypes:

## Most Frequently Mutated Genes in CN-High Subtype:

1. **TP53** - This is the hallmark mutation of CN-high endometrial cancers, occurring in approximately **90-95%** of cases, which is significantly higher than other subtypes

2. **PIK3CA** - Frequently mutated (30-40% of cases)

3. **PPP2R1A** - More common in CN-high subtype (20-30%)

4. **FBXW7** - Present in approximately 20% of cases

5. **PIK3R1** - Occurs in 15-20% of cases

## Key Differences from Other Subtypes:

- **POLE ultramutated**: Characterized by POLE mutations and extremely high mutation burden
- **MSI-hypermutated**: High mutation rates in genes like PTEN, PIK3CA, ARID1A, PIK3R1, KTEN, and RPL22, but lower TP53 mutation frequency
- **CN-low (endometrioid)**: Frequent mutations in PTEN (>75%), PIK3CA, ARID1A, CTNNB1, but very low TP53 mutation rates (<10%)

The **near-universal TP53 mutation combined with high copy number alterations** is the defining molecular characteristic that distinguishes CN-high endometrial cancers from other subtypes.
