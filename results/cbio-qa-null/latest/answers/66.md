# Question 66

**Type:** Cross-Cohort Comparison

**Question:** In colorectal cancer do patients with microsatellite instability in the TCGA dataset have a similar prognosis as those in the MSK Gastroenterology 2020 study?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to real-time cBioPortal data to compare survival outcomes between these two specific datasets. However, I can provide some context:

To answer your question properly, you would need to:

1. **Access the TCGA Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD) dataset** in cBioPortal and filter patients by MSI status (MSI-High vs MSS/MSI-Low)

2. **Access the MSK Gastroenterology 2020 dataset** and similarly stratify by MSI status

3. **Compare survival curves** (overall survival and/or disease-free survival) between MSI-High patients in both cohorts

**General knowledge about MSI in colorectal cancer:**
- MSI-High colorectal cancers typically have **better prognosis** in early-stage disease compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors
- However, prognosis can vary based on:
  - Stage at diagnosis
  - Treatment received
  - Patient demographics
  - Study cohort characteristics (academic center vs population-based)

The MSK Gastroenterology 2020 study represents a clinical cohort from a single institution, while TCGA is a research cohort with specific inclusion criteria, so there may be differences in patient selection that could affect survival comparisons.

**To get the actual answer**, I recommend using cBioPortal's comparison features to directly analyze and compare survival data between these two studies.
