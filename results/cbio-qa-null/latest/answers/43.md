# Question 43

**Type:** Clonality Analysis

**Question:** "In samples with both KRAS and NRAS mutations, what is the distribution of variant allele frequencies suggesting clonal vs subclonal events?"

**Answer:**

# Analysis of KRAS and NRAS Co-mutation VAF Distribution

To analyze the variant allele frequencies (VAF) in samples with both KRAS and NRAS mutations and determine clonal vs subclonal patterns, you would need to:

## Query Approach in cBioPortal:

1. **Identify Co-mutated Samples:**
   - Select a study (e.g., TCGA PanCancer Atlas)
   - Query for samples with mutations in both KRAS AND NRAS
   - Use the query: `KRAS: MUT NRAS: MUT`

2. **Access VAF Data:**
   - Navigate to the "Mutations" tab in results
   - Download mutation data which includes VAF information (often listed as "Variant Allele Frequency" or calculated from tumor_var_freq)

## Clonal vs Subclonal Interpretation:

**Clonal mutations** (early, founder events):
- VAF typically **>25-30%** in diploid regions
- VAF ~50% suggests clonal mutation in diploid region
- Both mutations at high VAF suggests co-occurrence as early events

**Subclonal mutations** (later, secondary events):
- VAF typically **<25%**
- Lower VAF suggests acquisition after initial tumor expansion
- One high + one low VAF suggests sequential acquisition

## Expected Patterns:

Since KRAS and NRAS are typically **mutually exclusive** in most cancers (both activate the same pathway), co-occurrence usually indicates:
- **Subclonal populations** with different mutations
- **Spatial heterogeneity** (different tumor regions)
- VAF pattern: typically one higher (~30-50%) and one lower (<20%)

**Note:** Actual VAF data requires downloading the mutation file from cBioPortal for quantitative analysis, as the web interface doesn't automatically calculate these distributions.
