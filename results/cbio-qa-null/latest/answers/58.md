# Question 58

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Gene Alteration

**Question:** In the “Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes” study what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from cBioPortal or the ability to query the "Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes" study directly. To answer your specific question about survival differences between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only KRAS mutations, you would need to:

1. **Access cBioPortal** (https://www.cbioportal.org/)
2. **Select the "Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes" study** (PCAWG)
3. **Use the query interface** to define two patient groups:
   - Group 1: Patients with mutations in both TP53 AND KRAS
   - Group 2: Patients with mutations in KRAS only (without TP53 mutations)
4. **Navigate to the "Comparison/Survival" tab** to view:
   - Kaplan-Meier survival curves
   - Median survival times for each group
   - Log-rank test p-value for statistical significance
   - Hazard ratio with confidence intervals

The statistical significance is typically reported as a p-value from the log-rank test, where p < 0.05 is generally considered statistically significant.

If you'd like, I can guide you through the specific steps to perform this analysis in cBioPortal, or you can perform the query yourself to get the exact survival statistics for these mutation combinations.
