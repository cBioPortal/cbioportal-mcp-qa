# Question 37

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Gene Alteration

**Question:** Do ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 alterations have significantly different overall survival compared to wild-type patients?

**Answer:**

Based on clinical studies and data available in cBioPortal, ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 alterations generally show **better overall survival** compared to wild-type patients, though the relationship is complex.

## Key Findings:

**Better Prognosis with BRCA Mutations:**
- Multiple studies have demonstrated that ovarian cancer patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations have improved overall survival compared to BRCA wild-type patients
- This survival advantage is typically in the range of 12-24 months longer median survival
- The improved outcomes are observed particularly in high-grade serous ovarian cancer

**Reasons for Better Outcomes:**
1. **PARP inhibitor sensitivity** - BRCA-mutated tumors are highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors due to synthetic lethality
2. **Platinum sensitivity** - BRCA-mutated tumors generally respond better to platinum-based chemotherapy
3. **Homologous recombination deficiency** - Makes tumors more vulnerable to DNA-damaging agents

**Important Considerations:**
- The survival benefit is most pronounced in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy and/or PARP inhibitors
- BRCA2 mutations may confer slightly better prognosis than BRCA1 mutations in some studies
- The survival advantage can vary by stage at diagnosis and treatment received

You can explore specific ovarian cancer datasets in cBioPortal to examine survival curves comparing BRCA-altered versus wild-type patients in different cohorts.
