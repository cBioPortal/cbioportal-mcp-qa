# Question 44

**Type:** Hypermutation Phenotype

**Question:** What percentage of endometrial cancer samples have hypermutation (>5000 mutations) and how does this correlate with histological subtype?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the specific mutation count data and histological subtype information from cBioPortal's endometrial cancer studies that would be needed to answer this question accurately.

However, I can provide some general context about endometrial cancer and hypermutation:

**What you would need to investigate in cBioPortal:**

1. **Select an endometrial cancer study** (such as TCGA Endometrial Cancer studies)
2. **Access mutation data** - Look at the mutation count per sample
3. **Filter for hypermutated samples** - Identify samples with >5000 mutations
4. **Correlate with clinical data** - Compare against histological subtype information

**General knowledge about endometrial cancer:**

Endometrial cancers are known to have distinct molecular subtypes, including:
- **POLE-mutated** tumors (ultramutated, often >100 mutations/Mb)
- **MSI-high** tumors (hypermutated due to mismatch repair deficiency)
- **Copy-number low** tumors
- **Copy-number high/serous-like** tumors

Hypermutated tumors are typically associated with endometrioid histology (POLE-mutated) or can occur in both endometrioid and serous types (MSI-high).

**To get the exact answer**, you would need to query the specific dataset in cBioPortal and perform this correlation analysis directly.
