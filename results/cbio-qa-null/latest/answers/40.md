# Question 40

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the most frequently altered genes in KRAS wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients?

**Answer:**

In KRAS wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients, the most frequently altered genes include:

1. **EGFR** - One of the most common alterations, particularly in never-smokers and Asian populations, with mutations occurring in 10-35% of lung adenocarcinomas overall (higher in KRAS wild-type subset)

2. **TP53** - Frequently mutated across lung adenocarcinomas, including KRAS wild-type cases

3. **ALK** - Rearrangements/fusions occur in 3-7% of lung adenocarcinomas, almost exclusively in KRAS wild-type tumors

4. **ROS1** - Fusions found in 1-2% of cases, mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations

5. **BRAF** - Mutations occur in 1-3% of lung adenocarcinomas, typically in KRAS wild-type patients

6. **MET** - Amplifications and exon 14 skipping mutations, occurring in KRAS wild-type subset

7. **RET** - Fusions in 1-2% of cases, mutually exclusive with KRAS

8. **ERBB2 (HER2)** - Mutations and amplifications in 2-4% of cases

9. **STK11 (LKB1)** - Though can co-occur with KRAS, also altered in KRAS wild-type cases

10. **NRG1, NTRK1/2/3** - Rare fusions in KRAS wild-type patients

These alterations are often mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations and represent important therapeutic targets in lung adenocarcinoma.
