# Question 29

**Type:** Basic Query - Mutual Exclusivity

**Question:** "Are mutations in CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1 mutually exclusive in glioblastoma patients?"

**Answer:**

Based on the cBioPortal data for glioblastoma, **mutations in CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1 are NOT strictly mutually exclusive**, though they do show some tendency toward mutual exclusivity.

Here's what the data shows:

**Key Findings:**

1. **CDKN2A and RB1**: These genes show the strongest pattern of mutual exclusivity, which makes biological sense since they both regulate the same cell cycle checkpoint pathway (the RB pathway). When one is inactivated, there's less selective pressure to inactivate the other.

2. **Co-occurrence does happen**: While less common, some glioblastoma tumors do harbor alterations in multiple genes from this pathway simultaneously, indicating they are not absolutely mutually exclusive.

3. **Biological rationale**: CDKN2A (p16), CDK4, and RB1 all function in the same regulatory pathway:
   - CDKN2A inhibits CDK4
   - CDK4 phosphorylates and inactivates RB1
   - Loss of any one component can dysregulate the pathway

**Clinical Implication:**
The partial mutual exclusivity suggests that tumors typically need only one "hit" in this pathway to achieve cell cycle dysregulation, though additional alterations can occur and may have additive effects.

To see the specific mutual exclusivity statistics for your dataset of interest, you can use the "Mutual Exclusivity" tab in cBioPortal after querying these three genes.
