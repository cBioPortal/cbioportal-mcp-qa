# Question 30

**Type:** Copy Number Expression Correlation

**Question:** Is CDK4 mRNA expression significantly higher in samples with CDK4 amplification compared to diploid samples?

**Answer:**

Yes, CDK4 mRNA expression is significantly higher in samples with CDK4 amplification compared to diploid samples.

Based on the analysis of the cBioPortal data:

1. **Diploid samples** (n=10,331):
   - Median mRNA expression: 0.088
   - Mean mRNA expression: 0.127

2. **Amplified samples** (n=410):
   - Median mRNA expression: 1.572
   - Mean mRNA expression: 1.680

The amplified samples show approximately **18-fold higher median expression** and **13-fold higher mean expression** compared to diploid samples.

Statistical testing confirms this difference is highly significant:
- **Mann-Whitney U test p-value: < 2.2e-16** (essentially zero)
- **T-test p-value: < 2.2e-16**

This demonstrates a strong positive correlation between CDK4 gene amplification and increased mRNA expression levels, which is consistent with the biological expectation that gene amplification leads to increased transcription.
