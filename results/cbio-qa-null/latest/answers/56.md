# Question 56

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?

**Answer:**

# MGMT Promoter Methylation in Glioblastoma

MGMT (O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase) promoter methylation is one of the most important biomarkers in glioblastoma management:

## Impact on Prognosis

**Better Overall Survival:**
- Patients with MGMT promoter methylation have significantly longer survival compared to unmethylated cases
- Median survival improvement of approximately 6-8 months in many studies
- The methylation silences the MGMT DNA repair gene, making tumors more vulnerable to DNA-damaging therapies

## Impact on Treatment Response

**Enhanced Chemotherapy Sensitivity:**
- **Temozolomide (TMZ)**: MGMT methylation predicts superior response to this alkylating chemotherapy agent
- Unmethylated MGMT allows the repair enzyme to fix DNA damage caused by TMZ, reducing treatment effectiveness
- Methylated MGMT = silenced repair mechanism = better drug efficacy

**Clinical Decision-Making:**
- MGMT status helps guide treatment intensity and selection
- Methylated patients: Strong candidates for aggressive TMZ-based chemotherapy
- Unmethylated patients: May benefit from alternative or intensified treatment strategies

## Key Statistics

- Approximately 40-45% of glioblastomas show MGMT promoter methylation
- Methylated patients receiving TMZ: ~21-24 month median survival
- Unmethylated patients: ~12-15 month median survival

MGMT methylation status is now routinely tested in glioblastoma patients to personalize treatment approaches and provide prognostic information.
