# Question 19

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 10 most frequently mutated genes across all cancer types in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to real-time cBioPortal data or the specific mutation frequencies from the MSK-CHORD Study. To find the top 10 most frequently mutated genes in this study, you should:

1. **Visit cBioPortal** at www.cbioportal.org

2. **Search for the MSK-CHORD Study** in the study selection page

3. **Select all samples** from the study

4. **Navigate to the "Mutations" tab** or use the "Cancer Gene Census" view

5. **Look at the OncoPrint or mutation frequency table** which will show genes ranked by their mutation frequency

Alternatively, you can:
- Use the **"Plots" tab** to visualize mutation frequencies
- Check the **"Summary" page** which often displays the most frequently altered genes
- Download the mutation data for custom analysis

The MSK-CHORD study typically includes patients with various cancer types, so the most frequently mutated genes would likely include common cancer drivers such as TP53, PIK3CA, KRAS, and others, but the exact ranking would depend on the specific cancer type distribution in the cohort.

Would you like guidance on how to navigate cBioPortal to find this information yourself?
