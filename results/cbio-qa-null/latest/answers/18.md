# Question 18

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What are the most frequently administered systemic therapy regimens for lung cancer patients in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to specific information about the systemic therapy regimens administered to lung cancer patients in the MSK-CHORD Study from the provided context.

To find this information, you would need to:

1. **Access the MSK-CHORD dataset** in cBioPortal directly
2. **Look at the clinical data** associated with lung cancer patients in that study
3. **Review treatment/therapy information** if available in the clinical attributes

The MSK-CHORD (MSK-Clinical and Hematologic Outcomes Registry Database) is a large observational study, but the specific treatment regimen data would need to be examined within the dataset itself. This information might be found in:

- Clinical data tables under treatment-related fields
- Timeline data showing therapy administration
- Study publications or supplementary materials associated with MSK-CHORD

If you have access to cBioPortal, I recommend navigating to the MSK-CHORD study and filtering for lung cancer patients, then examining the available clinical attributes related to treatment or therapy.
