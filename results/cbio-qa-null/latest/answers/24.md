# Question 24

**Type:** Treatment Response

**Question:** Which genomic alterations are associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to the specific MSK-CHORD Study data in cBioPortal to provide you with the exact genomic alterations associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma patients from that particular study.

However, I can tell you that in general melanoma immunotherapy response studies typically examine alterations in genes such as:

1. **BRAF** - mutations (especially V600E)
2. **NRAS** - mutations
3. **NF1** - mutations/loss
4. **PTEN** - loss/mutations
5. **Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB)** - higher TMB often associated with better response
6. **JAK1/JAK2** - mutations associated with resistance
7. **B2M** - loss associated with resistance

To find the specific findings from the MSK-CHORD Study in cBioPortal, you would need to:

1. Search for "MSK-CHORD" or "CHORD" in the study selection page
2. Select melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy
3. Look at the genomic alterations tab
4. Compare responders vs. non-responders

If you have access to cBioPortal, I'd be happy to help you navigate to find this specific information, or if you can share what you see in the study, I can help interpret the results.
