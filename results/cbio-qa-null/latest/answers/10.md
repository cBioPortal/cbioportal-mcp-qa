# Question 10

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What is the median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the specific median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma patients in the TARGET study from the information provided. However, I can tell you that osteosarcoma typically occurs in adolescents and young adults, with peak incidence during the teenage growth spurt years (around 10-20 years of age).

To find the exact median age at diagnosis for the TARGET osteosarcoma cohort in cBioPortal, you would need to:

1. Navigate to the TARGET osteosarcoma study in cBioPortal
2. Go to the "Clinical Data" tab
3. Look for the age at diagnosis distribution in the clinical attributes

The TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) initiative specifically focuses on childhood cancers, so the cohort would consist primarily of pediatric and young adult patients.

If you need the exact median value, I recommend accessing the study directly in cBioPortal or checking the associated publications for the TARGET osteosarcoma project.
