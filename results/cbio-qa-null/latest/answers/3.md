# Question 3

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the current data in cBioPortal to provide the exact number of primary samples in the MSK-CHORD Study. To find this information, you would need to:

1. Go to cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.org)
2. Search for "MSK-CHORD" in the study selection page
3. Select the study to view its details, which will show the number of samples and their types

Alternatively, you can look at the study's summary page once you've selected it, which typically displays sample counts including how many are primary samples versus other sample types (like metastatic or recurrent samples).
