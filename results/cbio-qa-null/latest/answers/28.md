# Question 28

**Type:** Basic Query - Pathway Analysis

**Question:** "What percentage of glioblastoma patients have alterations in RB pathway genes (CDKN2A, CDK4, RB1)?"

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time cBioPortal data to provide you with the exact current percentage. However, I can tell you that alterations in RB pathway genes are very common in glioblastoma.

To find the specific current percentage, you should:

1. Go to cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.org)
2. Select a glioblastoma study (such as "Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA, Firehose Legacy)" which is one of the largest datasets)
3. Enter the genes: CDKN2A, CDK4, and RB1
4. Click "Submit Query"

The results page will show you the percentage of cases with alterations in these genes.

**What you'll typically find:**
- CDKN2A alterations are among the most frequent in glioblastoma (often 50-60% of cases)
- CDK4 amplifications occur in approximately 15-20% of cases
- RB1 alterations occur in approximately 10-15% of cases
- Overall, when combined, RB pathway alterations affect the majority of glioblastoma patients (often 70-80% or more)

These genes are core components of the RB tumor suppressor pathway, and their disruption is a hallmark of glioblastoma pathogenesis.
