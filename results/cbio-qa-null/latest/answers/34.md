# Question 34

**Type:** Protein Expression Correlation

**Question:** What is the correlation between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels in ovarian cancer samples?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from cBioPortal to provide you with the specific correlation coefficient between EGFR mRNA expression and EGFR protein levels in ovarian cancer samples.

However, I can guide you on how to find this information in cBioPortal:

1. **Navigate to cBioPortal** (www.cbioportal.org)

2. **Select an ovarian cancer study** that contains both mRNA expression and protein level data (such as TCGA Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma studies with RPPA data)

3. **Query for EGFR** in the gene search box

4. **Go to the "Plots" tab** after the results load

5. **Select "Plot" and choose:**
   - X-axis: EGFR mRNA expression
   - Y-axis: EGFR protein level (RPPA or mass spectrometry data if available)

6. The correlation coefficient (Pearson or Spearman) will be displayed on the plot

**General observations from published literature:**
- mRNA-protein correlations vary widely across genes
- For EGFR specifically, correlations are typically moderate (r = 0.3-0.6) due to post-transcriptional regulation
- Protein stability, degradation, and translation efficiency affect this relationship

Would you like help with accessing a specific ovarian cancer dataset in cBioPortal to examine this correlation?
