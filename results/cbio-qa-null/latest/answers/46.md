# Question 46

**Type:** Pan-Cancer BRAF Analysis

**Question:** Which cancer types show the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

Based on TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies, the cancer types showing the highest frequency of BRAF V600E mutations are:

1. **Thyroid Cancer (THCA)** - approximately 60-65% frequency, making it the highest
2. **Melanoma (SKCM)** - approximately 40-50% frequency
3. **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD)** - approximately 8-10% frequency
4. **Low-Grade Glioma (LGG)** - approximately 5-10% frequency

**Thyroid cancer** has by far the highest prevalence of BRAF V600E mutations among all TCGA cancer types. This mutation is particularly common in papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common subtype of thyroid cancer.

**Melanoma** shows the second highest frequency, where BRAF V600E is a well-established driver mutation and the target of FDA-approved therapies like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.

The BRAF V600E mutation is relatively rare in most other cancer types in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas, typically occurring at frequencies below 5%.
