# Question 32

**Type:** Hotspot Mutation Analysis

**Question:** What are the most frequent EGFR mutation variants in lung adenocarcinoma and what percentage are known hotspot mutations?

**Answer:**

Based on lung adenocarcinoma data in cBioPortal, the most frequent EGFR mutation variants are:

## Most Common EGFR Mutations:

1. **L858R** (exon 21) - ~40-45% of EGFR mutations
2. **Exon 19 deletions** (del E746-A750 and variants) - ~45-50% of EGFR mutations
3. **T790M** (exon 20) - ~10-15%, often as acquired resistance
4. **G719X** (exon 18) - ~3-5%
5. **L861Q** (exon 21) - ~2-3%
6. **Exon 20 insertions** - ~4-10%

## Hotspot Mutation Percentage:

Approximately **85-90% of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma are known hotspot mutations**, primarily consisting of:
- L858R point mutation
- Exon 19 deletions (particularly del E746-A750)

These two categories alone account for ~85% of all EGFR mutations and are considered **sensitizing mutations** to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

The remaining mutations include less common variants, with T790M being particularly important as it's the most common resistance mechanism to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs.
