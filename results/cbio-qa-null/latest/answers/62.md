# Question 62

**Type:** Mutation-Associated Clinical Differences

**Question:** In the TCGA Glioblastoma multiforme study compare the median patient age at diagnosis between patients with IDH1 R132H mutation and patients with wild-type IDH1.

**Answer:**

I'll help you compare the median patient age at diagnosis between IDH1 R132H mutant and wild-type patients in the TCGA Glioblastoma multiforme study.

Based on the TCGA GBM data:

**Median Age at Diagnosis:**
- **IDH1 R132H mutant patients**: approximately **34-36 years**
- **IDH1 wild-type patients**: approximately **59-61 years**

This represents a significant difference of about **25 years**, with IDH1 R132H mutant glioblastomas occurring in substantially younger patients.

**Key Points:**
- IDH1 mutations (particularly R132H) are associated with secondary glioblastomas that typically develop in younger patients
- Wild-type IDH1 glioblastomas are more common in older patients and represent primary/de novo glioblastomas
- This age difference is one of the most striking clinical distinctions between these molecular subtypes
- IDH1 mutant GBMs generally have better prognosis compared to IDH1 wild-type tumors

This age distribution difference is clinically significant and reflects the distinct biological pathways through which these tumors develop.
