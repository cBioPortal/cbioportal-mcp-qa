# Question 59

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?

**Answer:**

Yes, there are studies in cBioPortal that used ribosomal RNA depletion (ribo-depletion) instead of polyA enrichment to better capture long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). 

One notable example is the **TCGA PanCancer Atlas Studies**, which include RNA sequencing data processed using ribo-depletion methods. This approach is specifically designed to retain non-polyadenylated transcripts, including many lncRNAs that would be lost with standard polyA enrichment protocols.

Studies focused on lncRNA biology typically avoid polyA enrichment because:
1. Many lncRNAs lack polyA tails
2. Ribo-depletion provides more comprehensive transcriptome coverage
3. It allows better detection of non-coding RNA species

When exploring lncRNA-related questions in cBioPortal, look for studies that specifically mention "ribo-depletion," "total RNA," or "ribosomal RNA depletion" in their methodology descriptions.
