# Question 49

**Type:** Aneuploidy Analysis

**Question:** Which cancer types have the highest aneuploidy scores and how does this correlate with mutation burden across TCGA Pan-Cancer studies?

**Answer:**

# Aneuploidy Scores and Mutation Burden Across TCGA Pan-Cancer Studies

Based on TCGA Pan-Cancer analyses, here are the key findings regarding aneuploidy scores and their correlation with mutation burden:

## Cancer Types with Highest Aneuploidy Scores:

1. **Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (OV)** - Consistently shows the highest aneuploidy scores
2. **Uterine Carcinosarcoma (UCS)** - Very high aneuploidy
3. **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)** - High aneuploidy
4. **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA)** - High aneuploidy
5. **Esophageal Carcinoma (ESCA)** - High aneuploidy
6. **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC)** - High aneuploidy

## Cancer Types with Lowest Aneuploidy Scores:

- **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (LAML)**
- **Thyroid Carcinoma (THCA)**
- **Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PCPG)**

## Correlation with Mutation Burden:

**Inverse Correlation**: Studies have shown a **negative correlation** between aneuploidy scores and mutation burden:

- Cancers with **high aneuploidy** tend to have **lower mutation rates**
- Cancers with **low aneuploidy** often have **higher mutation rates**

### Examples:
- **High aneuploidy/Low mutation**: OV, LUSC
- **Low aneuploidy/High mutation**: Endometrial (UCEC), Colorectal (COADREAD), Melanoma (SKCM)

This inverse relationship suggests different mechanisms of genomic instability driving tumorigenesis across cancer types.
