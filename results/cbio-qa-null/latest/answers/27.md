# Question 27

**Type:** Expression Analysis

**Question:** Is there a correlation between ERBB2 gene amplification and ERBB2 protein expression levels in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to the MSK-CHORD study data to analyze the correlation between ERBB2 gene amplification and ERBB2 protein expression levels in breast cancer samples.

However, I can tell you that in general:

1. **ERBB2 (HER2) amplification and protein expression are typically correlated** - Gene amplification usually leads to protein overexpression, which is why HER2 status in breast cancer is assessed through both methods (IHC for protein expression and FISH/ISH for gene amplification).

2. **To investigate this in the MSK-CHORD study specifically**, you would need to:
   - Access the study in cBioPortal
   - Select breast cancer samples
   - Query for ERBB2 alterations (copy number amplification)
   - Compare with ERBB2 protein expression data (if available via RPPA or mass spectrometry)
   - Use the "Plots" tab to create a scatter plot comparing copy number vs. protein expression

3. **The correlation is generally strong but not perfect** - Some samples may show amplification without proportional protein expression due to post-transcriptional regulation, and vice versa.

If you have access to cBioPortal, you can perform this analysis directly by querying ERBB2 in the MSK-CHORD dataset and examining the relationship between genomic and proteomic data if both are available.
