# Question 54

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?

**Answer:**

The most common KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer are:

1. **KRAS G12D** (Glycine to Aspartic acid at codon 12) - Most frequent
2. **KRAS G12V** (Glycine to Valine at codon 12)
3. **KRAS G13D** (Glycine to Aspartic acid at codon 13)
4. **KRAS G12C** (Glycine to Cysteine at codon 12)
5. **KRAS G12A** (Glycine to Alanine at codon 12)

**Key points:**
- Approximately 40-45% of colorectal cancers harbor KRAS mutations
- Codon 12 mutations account for ~80-85% of all KRAS mutations in CRC
- Codon 13 mutations account for ~15-20%
- G12D is typically the single most common variant, representing about 35-40% of all KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer
- These mutations are mutually exclusive and occur in exon 2 of the KRAS gene
- KRAS mutations are important biomarkers as they predict resistance to anti-EGFR therapies (cetuximab, panitumumab)

You can explore the specific frequencies in different colorectal cancer studies on cBioPortal by searching for colorectal or colon cancer studies and examining the KRAS mutation distribution.
