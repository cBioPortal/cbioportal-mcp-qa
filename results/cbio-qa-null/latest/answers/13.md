# Question 13

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What percentage of patients in the MSK-CHORD Study have at least one TP53 mutation?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from cBioPortal or the specific MSK-CHORD study dataset. To find the percentage of patients with at least one TP53 mutation in the MSK-CHORD study, you would need to:

1. Go to cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org/)
2. Search for and select the "MSK-CHORD" study
3. Query for TP53 mutations
4. Review the OncoPrint or summary statistics that show the alteration frequency

The results page will typically display the percentage of patients/samples with TP53 mutations directly in the summary statistics.

If you have access to cBioPortal, I'd be happy to help you interpret the results once you retrieve them, or guide you through the specific steps to find this information.
