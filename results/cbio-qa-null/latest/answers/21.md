# Question 21

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the most commonly co-occurring mutation pairs in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to the specific mutation co-occurrence data from the MSK-CHORD study in the cBioPortal database. However, I can guide you on how to find this information:

1. **Access the study**: Go to cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.org) and search for "MSK-CHORD" or navigate to the breast cancer studies section.

2. **Query the data**: Select the breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD study and proceed to the query page.

3. **View co-occurrence**: After running your query:
   - Go to the "Mutations" tab
   - Look for "Mutual Exclusivity" or "Co-occurrence" analysis
   - This will show you statistically significant mutation pairs that occur together

4. **Common patterns in breast cancer**: Based on general breast cancer genomics knowledge, commonly co-occurring mutations often include:
   - PIK3CA with other pathway members
   - TP53 with various genes depending on subtype
   - Mutations within the same pathway (e.g., PI3K/AKT pathway members)

To get the specific answer for MSK-CHORD breast cancer samples, you would need to perform this analysis directly in cBioPortal, as the co-occurrence patterns can vary by study cohort and sequencing panel used.

Would you like guidance on how to perform this analysis step-by-step in cBioPortal?
