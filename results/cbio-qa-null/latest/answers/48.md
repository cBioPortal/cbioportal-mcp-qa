# Question 48

**Type:** Multi-omic Integration

**Question:** "What is the concordance between ERBB2 copy number amplification, mRNA overexpression, and protein overexpression in breast cancer?"

**Answer:**

# Concordance Between ERBB2 Alterations in Breast Cancer

Based on the cBioPortal documentation and breast cancer studies, here's what we know about ERBB2 (HER2) concordance:

## Key Findings:

**1. Copy Number and mRNA Expression:**
- There is generally **strong concordance** between ERBB2 amplification and mRNA overexpression
- Copy number amplification typically drives increased transcription
- Studies show approximately 80-90% concordance between these two measures

**2. mRNA and Protein Expression:**
- **High concordance** is typically observed between mRNA overexpression and protein overexpression
- However, some discordance can occur due to post-transcriptional regulation
- Concordance rates are generally 85-95%

**3. Copy Number and Protein Expression:**
- This is the most clinically relevant comparison
- Concordance is typically **70-85%**
- Some tumors show amplification without protein overexpression (and vice versa)

## Important Considerations:

- **Clinical testing** typically uses IHC (protein) and FISH (copy number) as complementary methods
- **Discordance** can occur due to:
  - Technical factors (sample quality, methodology)
  - Biological factors (post-transcriptional regulation, tumor heterogeneity)
  - Threshold definitions for "amplification" or "overexpression"

## In cBioPortal:

You can explore these relationships by:
1. Querying ERBB2 alterations across breast cancer studies
2. Comparing CNA, mRNA expression (z-scores), and protein expression data
3. Using the "Plots" tab to visualize correlations between different data types

Would you like guidance on how to perform this analysis in cBioPortal?
