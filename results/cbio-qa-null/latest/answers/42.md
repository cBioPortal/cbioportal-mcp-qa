# Question 42

**Type:** Co-occurring Mutations

**Question:** What percentage of endometrial cancer patients have co-occurring oncogenic mutations in both KRAS and NRAS?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time cBioPortal data to provide the exact percentage of endometrial cancer patients with co-occurring oncogenic mutations in both KRAS and NRAS.

However, I can tell you that:

1. **Co-occurring KRAS and NRAS mutations are extremely rare** in most cancer types, including endometrial cancer, because these genes function in the same pathway (RAS/MAPK pathway) and mutations in one typically provide sufficient pathway activation.

2. **In endometrial cancer specifically:**
   - KRAS mutations are relatively common (15-30% of cases)
   - NRAS mutations are much less frequent (typically <5%)
   - Co-occurrence would be expected to be very rare (<1-2%)

To get the precise answer for your question, you would need to:
- Go to cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.org)
- Select endometrial cancer studies
- Query for KRAS and NRAS mutations
- Look at the OncoPrint or mutual exclusivity analysis to see co-occurrence rates

Would you like guidance on how to perform this specific query in cBioPortal?
