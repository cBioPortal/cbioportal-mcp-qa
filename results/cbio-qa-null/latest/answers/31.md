# Question 31

**Type:** Cross-Cancer Mutation Frequency

**Question:** Which cancer types have the highest frequency of EGFR mutations across all TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to real-time cBioPortal data, but I can provide you with information based on established knowledge about EGFR mutations in TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies.

**Cancer types with the highest frequency of EGFR mutations typically include:**

1. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** - approximately 15-20% mutation frequency
2. **Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)** - approximately 25-30% mutation frequency (including amplifications)
3. **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC)** - approximately 10-15%
4. **Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD)** - lower mutation frequency but notable amplifications
5. **Esophageal Carcinoma** - moderate frequency

**To find the current data in cBioPortal:**

1. Go to cBioPortal.org
2. Select "TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas Studies"
3. Query for "EGFR"
4. View the "Cancer Type Summary" tab to see mutation frequencies across all cancer types

The mutation frequency can vary depending on whether you're looking at:
- Point mutations only
- Amplifications
- All alterations combined

Lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma consistently show the highest rates of EGFR alterations, which is why EGFR-targeted therapies are particularly relevant in these cancer types.
