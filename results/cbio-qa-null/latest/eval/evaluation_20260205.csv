  ""correctness_explanation"": ""The LLM output provides generally accurate information about MGMT methylation's positive impact on prognosis and treatment response. However, the specific survival statistics differ from the expected answer. The LLM states '~21-24 month median survival' for methylated patients and '~12-15 month' for unmethylated, while the expected answer provides more precise data: 23.5 months (standard radiation + TMZ) for methylated vs 12.7 months for unmethylated in comparable treatment. The directional accuracy is correct but specific numbers are approximations rather than exact data."",

  ""completeness_explanation"": ""The LLM output addresses the main question about prognosis and treatment response but lacks the detailed breakdown by specific treatment regimens provided in the expected answer. The expected answer differentiates between standard radiation, standard radiation plus TMZ, TMZ chemoradiation plus TMZ, and unspecified radiation, with specific survival data and confidence intervals for each. The LLM provides a more general overview without this granular treatment-specific analysis."",

For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,1.0,"The expected answer clearly states that this question cannot be answered with the cBioPortal database. The LLM output is incorrect because it provides a detailed answer about EML4-ALK variants, quality of life, and secondary cancer risk, which should not be answerable from the specified data source.",1.0,"The LLM failed to recognize that this question is out of scope for the cBioPortal database. Instead of stating that the question cannot be answered with the available data source, it provided a comprehensive answer drawing from general clinical knowledge, which does not address the actual limitation of the data source.",1.0,The output is excessively verbose given that the correct answer should simply state that this question cannot be answered with the cBioPortal database. The LLM provided multiple sections with detailed information that is not relevant to what the data source can provide.,1.0,"The LLM output completely fails the faithfulness criterion. The cBioPortal database does not contain information about long-term quality of life or secondary cancer risk by fusion variant. The entire response draws on external clinical knowledge rather than acknowledging the limitations of the specified data source.

It provides no survival difference data, no median survival times, and no statistical significance values. Instead, it only offers instructions on how the user could find this information themselves.",1.0,The output is excessively verbose for what amounts to a non-answer. It provides lengthy step-by-step instructions on how to use cBioPortal when the question expected specific numerical results from the study.,3.0,"While the LLM failed to provide the answer, it did not hallucinate or fabricate data.

Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,1.0,"The LLM Output is factually incorrect. It claims that TCGA PanCancer Atlas Studies used ribo-depletion methods and provides specific details about library preparation protocols.
