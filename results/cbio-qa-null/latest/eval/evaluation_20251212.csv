How many studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM output does not provide the correct answer of 492 studies. Instead, it states it doesn't have access to real-time data and provides only vague information about 'several hundred' studies.",1,The output completely fails to answer the specific question asked. It does not provide the number of studies (492) and instead deflects by suggesting ways to find the information.,1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing unnecessary instructions on how to find the information rather than simply answering the question. It includes multiple paragraphs when a direct answer was expected.",1,"The LLM completely ignores the provided context/source (cbioportal database) and the expected answer (492 studies). Instead, it relies on its own knowledge limitations and provides generic advice, showing no faithfulness to the given source."
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM output does not provide the correct answer. The expected answer is '24,950 Patients and 25,040 samples' but the LLM states it doesn't have access to this information, which is factually incorrect since the data should be available from the cBioPortal database context.",1,"The output completely fails to answer the specific question asked. Instead of providing the patient and sample counts, it only offers general guidance on how to find this information, leaving the user's question unanswered.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing unnecessary step-by-step instructions and formatting when a simple numerical answer was requested. The response includes irrelevant details about browsing cBioPortal and model information.",2,"While the LLM doesn't hallucinate false data, it incorrectly claims to not have access to information that should be available from the provided context (cBioPortal database). The suggestions about using cBioPortal are based on general knowledge rather than the specific context provided."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM output does not provide the correct answer of 15,928 primary samples. Instead, it states that it doesn't have access to the current data, which is factually incorrect given that the expected answer exists.",1,"The output completely fails to answer the specific question asked. Instead of providing the number of primary samples, it only gives instructions on how to find the information, leaving the user's question unanswered.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing unnecessary step-by-step instructions and explanations when a simple numerical answer was requested. The response could have been much more direct.",2,"While the LLM doesn't hallucinate false information, it fails to utilize the available context/source (cbioportal database) to provide the answer. It acknowledges the source but claims inability to access it rather than providing the available information."
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM failed to provide the correct answer (Fluorouracil) and instead stated it doesn't have access to the information, which is incorrect given that the expected answer suggests this information is available.",1,"The LLM completely failed to answer the specific question asked. Instead of providing the treatment information, it offered general guidance on how to find the information, leaving the user's question unanswered.",1,"The response is excessively verbose, providing unnecessary suggestions and navigation tips when a direct answer was expected. The formatting with headers and bullet points adds to the verbosity without addressing the core question.",2,"While the LLM doesn't hallucinate specific treatment information, it makes assumptions about what resources might be available in cBioPortal without being certain. It stays faithful by not making up data, but it doesn't properly utilize the available context/source."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,1,"The LLM output does not provide any specific mutation frequencies or gene names, while the expected answer shows specific genes (TP53, MUC16, TTN, ATRX, DNAH9) with their exact percentages. The output is factually unhelpful as it doesn't answer the question.",1,"The output completely fails to address the user's question. Instead of providing the requested top 5 most frequently mutated genes, it only offers instructions on how to find the information, leaving the question entirely unanswered.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing lengthy instructions and multiple alternative approaches when a simple list of genes with percentages was requested. The response contains unnecessary procedural details that don't contribute to answering the question.",2,"While the LLM correctly identifies that it should reference cBioPortal (which matches the provided context/source), it fails to use the available information and instead relies on general knowledge about how to navigate databases. It doesn't hallucinate false data, but it also doesn't utilize the context effectively."
