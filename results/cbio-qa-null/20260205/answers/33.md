# Question 33

**Type:** Copy Number Expression Correlation

**Question:** What is the correlation coefficient between EGFR copy number and EGFR mRNA expression in ovarian cancer?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from cBioPortal to provide you with the specific correlation coefficient between EGFR copy number and EGFR mRNA expression in ovarian cancer.

However, I can guide you on how to find this information:

1. **Go to cBioPortal** (www.cbioportal.org)
2. **Select an ovarian cancer study** (e.g., "Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2011)" or another relevant study)
3. **Query for EGFR**
4. Navigate to the **"Plots"** tab
5. Select **"Copy Number"** on one axis and **"mRNA Expression"** on the other
6. The correlation coefficient (typically Spearman or Pearson) will be displayed on the plot

Generally, in published literature, EGFR copy number and mRNA expression show **positive correlation** in ovarian cancer, with correlation coefficients typically ranging from **0.3 to 0.7** depending on the specific dataset and methodology used.

For the most accurate and current data specific to your study of interest, I recommend checking directly in cBioPortal using the steps above.
