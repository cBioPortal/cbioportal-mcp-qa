# Question 38

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Expression

**Question:** Do lung adenocarcinoma patients with high EGFR mRNA expression (top quartile) have different survival outcomes than those with low expression?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time survival data from cBioPortal to answer your specific question about lung adenocarcinoma patients with high versus low EGFR mRNA expression.

However, I can guide you on how to find this information in cBioPortal:

1. **Go to cBioPortal** (www.cbioportal.org)

2. **Select a lung adenocarcinoma study** (e.g., "Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)" or another relevant dataset)

3. **Query for EGFR** in the gene search box

4. **Navigate to the "Comparison/Survival" tab** after the query loads

5. **Use the mRNA expression data** to:
   - Split patients into groups (high vs. low expression)
   - View Kaplan-Meier survival curves
   - Check for statistical significance (p-value from log-rank test)

**What the literature suggests:**
- EGFR mutations (rather than just expression levels) are more commonly associated with survival outcomes
- High EGFR expression has shown variable prognostic significance across different studies
- The relationship may depend on whether patients received EGFR-targeted therapy

To get the specific answer for your quartile-based comparison, you would need to perform this analysis directly in cBioPortal using their survival analysis tools.
