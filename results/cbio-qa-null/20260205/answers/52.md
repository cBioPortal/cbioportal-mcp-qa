# Question 52

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to the current cBioPortal database to query the specific mutation frequencies in the TP53 gene for the TCGA breast cancer study. 

To find this information, you would need to:

1. Go to cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org)
2. Select the TCGA Breast Cancer study (likely "Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)" or "Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Firehose Legacy)")
3. Query for the TP53 gene
4. Navigate to the "Mutations" tab to see the mutation frequency table

Historically, common TP53 mutations in breast cancer include missense mutations at hotspot residues like R175, R248, and R273, but the exact most frequent mutation can vary depending on which TCGA breast cancer dataset you're examining.

Would you like guidance on how to navigate cBioPortal to find this information yourself?
