# Question 15

**Type:** Data Discovery

**Question:** How many total studies contain mutation data in the cBioPortal database?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from the cBioPortal database, so I cannot provide you with the current exact number of studies containing mutation data.

To find this information, you can:

1. **Visit cBioPortal directly** at https://www.cbioportal.org
2. **Go to the "Data Sets" page** where you can see all available studies
3. **Filter by "Mutation"** data type to see which studies contain mutation data

The number of studies with mutation data changes regularly as new studies are added to the database. As of recent years, there have been hundreds of cancer studies in cBioPortal, with the majority containing mutation data, but I recommend checking the website directly for the most current count.
