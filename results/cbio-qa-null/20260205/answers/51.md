# Question 51

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the specific age distribution data from the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET that would allow me to calculate what fraction of patients were older than five years at diagnosis.

To answer this question accurately, I would need to access the clinical data from the TARGET Neuroblastoma dataset in cBioPortal, specifically the age at diagnosis field. If you have access to cBioPortal, you can:

1. Navigate to the TARGET Neuroblastoma study
2. Go to the Clinical Data tab
3. Look at the "Age at Diagnosis" or similar demographic field
4. Calculate the proportion of patients with age > 5 years

Alternatively, this information might be available in the study's publication or supplementary materials associated with the TARGET Neuroblastoma project.
