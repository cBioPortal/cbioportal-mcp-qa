# Question 25

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Comparison

**Question:** How does the mutation landscape differ between primary and metastatic samples from the same patients in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have specific information about the mutation landscape differences between primary and metastatic samples from the same patients in the MSK-CHORD Study in my current knowledge base.

However, to investigate this question in cBioPortal, you could:

1. **Access the MSK-CHORD study** in cBioPortal
2. **Filter samples** by primary vs. metastatic sample type
3. **Compare mutation frequencies** between the two groups using the "Comparison/Survival" features
4. **Look for paired samples** from the same patients (if available) to do direct comparisons
5. **Examine specific genes** that show differential mutation rates between primary and metastatic sites

Typically, studies comparing primary and metastatic tumors often find:
- **Shared trunk mutations** present in both samples (representing early clonal events)
- **Additional mutations in metastases** (representing continued evolution)
- **Potential differences in mutation burden**
- **Alterations in specific pathways** that may be enriched in metastatic sites

For the most accurate and study-specific information about the MSK-CHORD cohort, I'd recommend reviewing the associated publication or exploring the data directly in cBioPortal's interface where you can perform these comparative analyses.
