# Question 53

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** How many patients have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from cBioPortal, so I cannot provide the exact current number of patients with EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) study.

However, I can tell you how to find this information:

1. Go to cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.org)
2. Select the "TCGA, PanCancer Atlas" or "TCGA, Firehose Legacy" dataset
3. Choose "Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)" or the equivalent LUAD study
4. Enter "EGFR" in the gene query box
5. Click "Submit Query"
6. Look at the OncoPrint or the "Cancer Type Summary" tab to see the number and percentage of cases with EGFR amplification

Historically, EGFR amplification occurs in approximately **5-7%** of lung adenocarcinoma cases in TCGA studies, which would translate to roughly **25-40 patients** out of the ~500+ samples typically in the TCGA LUAD cohort, but the exact number depends on which specific TCGA LUAD dataset you're querying.
