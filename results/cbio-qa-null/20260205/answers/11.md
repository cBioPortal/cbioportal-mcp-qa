# Question 11

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to real-time data from cBioPortal or the specific mutation frequencies for the MSK-CHORD Study. To find the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in this study, you would need to:

1. **Visit cBioPortal** (https://www.cbioportal.org)
2. **Search for "MSK-CHORD"** in the study selection page
3. **Select the study** and click "Query By Gene"
4. **View the study summary** which typically shows the most frequently mutated genes
5. **Check the "Mutated Genes" tab** or the study's summary statistics

Alternatively, you can:
- Go directly to the study page on cBioPortal
- Look at the "Cancer Gene Census" or "Mutated Genes" section
- Sort genes by mutation frequency

The MSK-CHORD (Memorial Sloan Kettering - Comprehensive Harmonized Oncology Research Database) study typically includes data from various cancer types, so the most frequently mutated genes would likely include common cancer drivers such as TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, or APC, but the exact ranking would depend on the specific cohort composition.

Would you like guidance on how to navigate cBioPortal to find this information yourself?
