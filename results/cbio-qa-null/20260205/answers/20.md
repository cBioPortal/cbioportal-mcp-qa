# Question 20

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What percentage of colorectal cancer samples have KRAS mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from cBioPortal or specific mutation frequencies for the MSK-CHORD study. To find the percentage of colorectal cancer samples with KRAS mutations in the MSK-CHORD Study, you would need to:

1. Go to cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org)
2. Search for "MSK-CHORD" or the full study name
3. Select the colorectal cancer samples from that study
4. Query for KRAS mutations
5. View the alteration frequency in the results

Alternatively, if you have access to the study page on cBioPortal, you can:
- Navigate to the study summary
- Filter for colorectal cancer samples
- Look at the gene mutation frequencies, specifically for KRAS

Generally speaking, KRAS mutations are found in approximately 40-50% of colorectal cancers across various studies, but the specific percentage in MSK-CHORD may vary.

Would you like guidance on how to navigate cBioPortal to find this information yourself?
