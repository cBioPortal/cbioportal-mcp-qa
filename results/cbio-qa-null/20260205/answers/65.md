# Question 65

**Type:** Stratified Mutation Burden Analysis

**Question:** What is the average tumor mutational burden of breast cancer patients who have at least two of the five most frequently mutated genes and how does this compare to the average TMB of all patients?

**Answer:**

I need to find information about tumor mutational burden (TMB) in breast cancer patients, specifically comparing those with at least two of the five most frequently mutated genes versus all patients.

Let me search for relevant information about TMB and frequently mutated genes in breast cancer.

The search results don't provide the specific statistical comparison you're asking about. However, I can explain what would be needed to answer this question:

To answer your question accurately, I would need:

1. **The five most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer** - These typically include TP53, PIK3CA, GATA3, CDH1, and MAP3K1, though this can vary by study and breast cancer subtype.

2. **TMB data for patients with ≥2 of these mutations** - The average TMB for the subset of patients carrying mutations in at least two of these five genes.

3. **TMB data for all breast cancer patients** - The overall average TMB across the entire cohort.

**General context about breast cancer TMB:**
- Breast cancer typically has a relatively low to intermediate TMB compared to other cancer types
- TMB can vary significantly by breast cancer subtype (e.g., triple-negative breast cancer often has higher TMB)
- Patients with multiple driver mutations might have different TMB profiles

To get this specific analysis, you would need to:
- Query a specific breast cancer study in cBioPortal
- Identify the top 5 mutated genes
- Filter patients with ≥2 mutations in these genes
- Compare TMB values between groups

Would you like me to help you navigate how to perform this analysis in cBioPortal with a specific study?
