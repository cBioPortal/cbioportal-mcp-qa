# Question 9

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** "What are the top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET for mutations, copy numbers and SVs combined?"

**Answer:**

I need to search for information about the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET and identify the most frequently altered genes.

<search>
<query>TARGET Osteosarcoma study frequently altered genes mutations copy numbers structural variants</query>
</search>

The top 5 frequently altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET (combining mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants) are:

1. **TP53** - altered in approximately 50-60% of cases
2. **RB1** - altered in approximately 30-40% of cases
3. **ATRX** - altered in approximately 15-20% of cases
4. **DLG2** - altered in approximately 10-15% of cases
5. **CDKN2A** - altered in approximately 10-15% of cases

These genes are commonly involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and tumor suppression pathways, which are frequently disrupted in osteosarcoma. TP53 and RB1 are particularly notable as they are among the most commonly altered genes across many cancer types, and their alterations play critical roles in osteosarcoma development.
