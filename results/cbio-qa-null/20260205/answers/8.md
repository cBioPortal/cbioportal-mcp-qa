# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently altered genes in a structural variant in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to real-time cBioPortal data to query the specific Osteosarcoma study from TARGET for structural variant information. However, I can guide you on how to find this information:

1. **Go to cBioPortal** (www.cbioportal.org)
2. **Search for** "TARGET Osteosarcoma" or "Osteosarcoma (TARGET)"
3. **Select the study** and click "Explore Selected Studies"
4. **Go to the "Plots" or "Mutations" tab**
5. **Look for structural variants** or filter by alteration type to include fusions/structural variants
6. **Check the OncoPrint or alteration frequency** to see which genes are most frequently affected by structural variants

Based on published literature about osteosarcoma, genes commonly affected by structural variants include:
- **TP53**
- **RB1**
- **ATRX**
- **DLG2**
- **PTEN**

However, for the most accurate and current data specific to the TARGET Osteosarcoma study's structural variants, you'll need to query cBioPortal directly using the steps above.

Would you like help with navigating any specific feature in cBioPortal?
