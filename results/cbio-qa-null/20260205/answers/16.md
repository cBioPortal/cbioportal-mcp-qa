# Question 16

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many unique patients have both primary and metastatic samples in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the specific patient-level data from the MSK-CHORD Study to determine how many unique patients have both primary and metastatic samples.

To find this information, you would need to:

1. Access the MSK-CHORD study in cBioPortal
2. Go to the study page and download the clinical data
3. Filter for patients who have samples from both primary and metastatic sites
4. Count the unique patient identifiers

Alternatively, you could use cBioPortal's API or the study's clinical data download feature to analyze the sample types associated with each patient ID.

If you have access to cBioPortal, I'd recommend navigating to the MSK-CHORD study page where you can explore the clinical attributes and sample information to answer this question.
