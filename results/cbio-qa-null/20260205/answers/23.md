# Question 23

**Type:** Clinical Data Correlation Analysis

**Question:** What is the correlation between tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability status in colorectal cancer patients from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to specific correlation data between tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status from the MSK-CHORD Study in my current knowledge base.

However, I can provide some general context about what is typically observed in colorectal cancer:

**General relationship between TMB and MSI in colorectal cancer:**

1. **MSI-High (MSI-H) tumors** typically have:
   - Significantly elevated TMB
   - Often 10-100+ mutations per megabase
   - Defective DNA mismatch repair (dMMR)

2. **Microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors** typically have:
   - Lower TMB
   - Usually <10 mutations per megabase
   - Proficient mismatch repair (pMMR)

To get the specific correlation data from the MSK-CHORD Study, you would need to:

1. Access the study directly in cBioPortal
2. Use the "Plots" tab to create a scatter plot with TMB on one axis and MSI status on the other
3. Review any published manuscripts associated with the study
4. Check the study's clinical data for both TMB values and MSI status

Would you like guidance on how to access this specific data in cBioPortal?
