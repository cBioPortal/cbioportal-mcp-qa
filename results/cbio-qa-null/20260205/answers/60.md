# Question 60

**Type:** Expression comparison

**Question:** In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to real-time cBioPortal data or the ability to query the database directly. However, I can guide you on how to find this information:

1. **Go to cBioPortal** (www.cbioportal.org)

2. **Select the study**: Search for "Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)" or the specific TCGA breast cancer study you're interested in

3. **Query for TP53**: 
   - Enter "TP53" in the gene query box
   - Select the study and proceed

4. **Access differential expression analysis**:
   - Go to the "Comparison/Survival" tab
   - Select "mRNA" data type
   - Compare samples with TP53 mutations vs. TP53 wild-type samples
   - Sort by log2 fold change (most negative values = most down-regulated)

5. **View results**: The table will show genes ranked by differential expression with statistical significance

The top down-regulated genes will have the most negative log2 fold change values and typically significant q-values (adjusted p-values).

If you need the specific gene list, you would need to perform this analysis directly in cBioPortal, as the results depend on the specific dataset version and analysis parameters used.
