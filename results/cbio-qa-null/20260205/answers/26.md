# Question 26

**Type:** Gene Panels

**Question:** What percentage of genomic events in the MSK-CHORD Study occur in genes that are off-panel (not covered by the sequencing panel used)?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to specific information about the percentage of genomic events that occur in off-panel genes in the MSK-CHORD Study from the provided context.

To answer this question accurately, I would need access to:
1. The specific sequencing panel used in the MSK-CHORD Study
2. Data on all genomic events detected
3. Information about which events occurred in genes covered vs. not covered by the panel

This type of analysis would typically be found in the study's supplementary materials or methods section. I recommend checking the original publication or contacting the study authors directly for this specific metric.
