# Question 22

**Type:** Survival Analysis

**Question:** Do patients with PIK3CA mutations have different overall survival outcomes compared to PIK3CA wild-type patients in breast cancer from the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to specific survival outcome data from the MSK-CHORD study that would allow me to compare overall survival between PIK3CA mutant and PIK3CA wild-type breast cancer patients.

To answer this question accurately, you would need to:

1. **Access the MSK-CHORD study in cBioPortal** and select breast cancer patients
2. **Query for PIK3CA mutations** to identify mutant vs wild-type patients
3. **Use the survival analysis tools** in cBioPortal to compare overall survival (OS) between these two groups
4. **Review the Kaplan-Meier curves** and statistical significance (log-rank p-value)

Generally in breast cancer literature, PIK3CA mutations are relatively common (30-40% of cases) and their prognostic impact can vary by:
- Breast cancer subtype (ER+, HER2+, triple-negative)
- Specific mutation hotspot (H1047R, E545K, etc.)
- Treatment context

If you have access to cBioPortal, I'd recommend navigating to the MSK-CHORD study and using the built-in survival analysis feature to generate this comparison directly from the data.
