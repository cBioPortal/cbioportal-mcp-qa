# Question 36

**Type:** Methylation Expression Analysis

**Question:** Is BRCA1 promoter methylation associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer?

**Answer:**

Yes, BRCA1 promoter methylation is associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer.

Studies have consistently shown that hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter region leads to transcriptional silencing of the BRCA1 gene in ovarian tumors. This epigenetic modification is one of the mechanisms by which BRCA1 function can be lost in sporadic ovarian cancers (those without germline BRCA1 mutations).

Key findings include:

1. **Frequency**: BRCA1 promoter methylation occurs in approximately 10-15% of sporadic ovarian cancers

2. **Functional consequence**: Methylation results in significantly reduced or absent BRCA1 mRNA and protein expression

3. **Clinical relevance**: Tumors with BRCA1 promoter methylation often exhibit a "BRCAness" phenotype, showing similar characteristics to tumors with BRCA1 mutations, including:
   - Increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy
   - Potential sensitivity to PARP inhibitors
   - Improved initial treatment response

4. **Reversibility**: Unlike genetic mutations, methylation is potentially reversible with demethylating agents

This epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 represents an important alternative mechanism of BRCA1 inactivation in ovarian cancer and has implications for treatment selection and prognosis.
