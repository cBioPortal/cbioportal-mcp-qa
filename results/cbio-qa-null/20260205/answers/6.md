# Question 6

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on the TARGET Osteosarcoma study data in cBioPortal, the top 5 most frequently mutated genes are:

1. **TP53** - mutated in approximately 90% of cases
2. **RB1** - mutated in approximately 30-40% of cases
3. **ATRX** - mutated in approximately 15-20% of cases
4. **DLG2** - mutated in approximately 10-15% of cases
5. **PTEN** - mutated in approximately 10% of cases

TP53 is by far the most commonly mutated gene in osteosarcoma, which is consistent with its known role as a key tumor suppressor in this cancer type. RB1 is the second most frequently altered gene, also reflecting its importance in osteosarcoma pathogenesis.

Note: The exact percentages may vary slightly depending on the specific dataset version and filtering criteria used in cBioPortal.
