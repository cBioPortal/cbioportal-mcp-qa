# Question 67

**Type:** Genomic Alteration–Subtype Association

**Question:** In the TCGA Breast Cancer study if a patient has both a PIK3CA mutation and a PTEN deletion what is their probability of having a luminal A subtype? Is this probability different from a patient with only a PIK3CA mutation?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to the cBioPortal database to query the specific TCGA Breast Cancer study data in real-time. However, I can guide you on how to find this information:

**To answer your question using cBioPortal:**

1. Go to cBioPortal.org and select the TCGA Breast Cancer study (BRCA)
2. Use the "Query" function to create two patient groups:
   - Group 1: Patients with PIK3CA mutations AND PTEN deletions
   - Group 2: Patients with PIK3CA mutations only (without PTEN alterations)
3. For each group, examine the clinical data for "PAM50 subtype" or "Breast Cancer Subtype" 
4. Calculate the percentage of Luminal A patients in each group

**What is generally known from the literature:**

- PIK3CA mutations are enriched in Luminal A breast cancers (~45% of Luminal A cases)
- PTEN loss is less common in Luminal A compared to other subtypes
- The combination of PIK3CA mutation + PTEN deletion might actually be less associated with Luminal A than PIK3CA mutation alone

To get the exact probabilities you're asking about, you would need to perform the query in cBioPortal and compare the proportions statistically. Would you like guidance on how to perform this specific query?
