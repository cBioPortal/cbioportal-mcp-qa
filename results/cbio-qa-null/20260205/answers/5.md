# Question 5

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to specific treatment information from the MSK-CHORD Study in the provided context. To answer your question about what treatment most patients received in this study, I would need to access the clinical data from that specific study in cBioPortal.

If you have access to cBioPortal, you can find this information by:
1. Navigating to the MSK-CHORD study
2. Looking at the clinical data tab
3. Examining the treatment-related variables or columns

Alternatively, you could check the study's publication or description page for treatment details.
