# Question 14

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** Which cancer type has the highest average tumor mutational burden across all studies?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from cBioPortal to determine which cancer type has the highest average tumor mutational burden (TMB) across all studies. However, I can provide some general information:

Based on published literature and typical cBioPortal data patterns, cancer types that commonly show the **highest tumor mutational burden** include:

1. **Melanoma** - particularly cutaneous melanoma, due to UV-induced mutations
2. **Lung cancer** - especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in smokers
3. **Bladder cancer** (urothelial carcinoma)
4. **Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors** - including colorectal and endometrial cancers with mismatch repair deficiency

To find the current answer in cBioPortal:
- Go to the cBioPortal homepage
- Use the "Explore Studies" feature
- Look for studies with TMB data
- Compare TMB values across different cancer types

The specific ranking can vary depending on which studies are included and how TMB is calculated (mutations per megabase).

Would you like guidance on how to query this information directly in cBioPortal?
