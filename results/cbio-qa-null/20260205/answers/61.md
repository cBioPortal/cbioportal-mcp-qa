# Question 61

**Type:** Survival Analysis - Clinical attributes

**Question:** In the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients who were older than four when diagnosed and the younger ones?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to the cBioPortal database to query the specific Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET and calculate the survival difference between patients diagnosed at age >4 versus ≤4 years old.

However, I can tell you that age at diagnosis is a well-established prognostic factor in neuroblastoma, with patients diagnosed at younger ages (typically <18 months or <12 months) generally having better outcomes than older patients.

To find this information in cBioPortal, you would need to:

1. Navigate to the TARGET Neuroblastoma study in cBioPortal
2. Access the clinical data for the cohort
3. Create patient groups based on age at diagnosis (>4 years vs ≤4 years)
4. Run a survival analysis comparing these two groups
5. Review the Kaplan-Meier curves, median survival times, and p-values (typically from log-rank test)

The statistical significance would typically be reported as a p-value, with p<0.05 generally considered statistically significant.

If you have access to cBioPortal, you can perform this analysis directly through their interface, or I can help guide you through the specific steps if needed.
