# Question 63

**Type:** Conditional correlation

**Question:** "In breast cancer, what is the correlation coefficient between EGFR expression levels and PIK3CA mutation status considering only patients who also have a homozygous deletion of PTEN?"

**Answer:**

I need to clarify that calculating this specific correlation coefficient requires access to the actual cBioPortal database with the ability to:

1. **Filter breast cancer patients** with homozygous deletion of PTEN
2. **Extract EGFR expression levels** (mRNA or protein data)
3. **Identify PIK3CA mutation status** (binary: mutated vs wild-type)
4. **Calculate the correlation** between these variables

**Important considerations:**

- **Correlation type**: Since PIK3CA mutation status is categorical (binary) and EGFR expression is continuous, you would typically use a **point-biserial correlation** or compare mean EGFR expression between mutated vs wild-type groups using a t-test
- **Sample size**: Homozygous PTEN deletions are relatively rare, so the subset may be small, affecting statistical power
- **Study selection**: Results will vary depending on which breast cancer study you query (TCGA, METABRIC, etc.)

**How to find this in cBioPortal:**

1. Go to cBioPortal and select a breast cancer study
2. Use the OQL (Onco Query Language) to filter:
   - `PTEN: HOMDEL` (homozygous deletion)
   - `PIK3CA: MUT` (mutations)
   - `EGFR` (for expression data)
3. Download the clinical and genomic data
4. Perform statistical analysis externally

**Without direct database access**, I cannot provide the exact correlation coefficient. Would you like guidance on how to perform this analysis yourself in cBioPortal?
