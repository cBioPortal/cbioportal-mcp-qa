# Question 17

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** What are the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the specific data from the MSK-CHORD Study to provide you with the top 5 most common primary diagnosis sites. 

To find this information, you would need to:

1. **Access the MSK-CHORD study directly in cBioPortal** at https://www.cbioportal.org/
2. **Search for "MSK-CHORD"** in the study selection page
3. **Navigate to the "Clinical Data" tab** once you've selected the study
4. **Look at the "Primary Diagnosis" or "Cancer Type" distribution** in the summary statistics

Alternatively, if you have access to the study, you can use the "Plots" or "Clinical" tabs to visualize the distribution of primary sites across all samples in the cohort.

If you can access cBioPortal directly, I'd be happy to help you interpret what you find or guide you through the navigation process.
