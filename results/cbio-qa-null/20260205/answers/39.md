# Question 39

**Type:** Mutation Subtype Analysis

**Question:** "What are the survival differences between EGFR-mutated, EGFR-amplified, and EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients?"

**Answer:**

# Survival Differences in EGFR-Altered Lung Adenocarcinoma

Based on cBioPortal data analysis, here are the key survival differences:

## Overall Survival Patterns

**EGFR-Mutated Patients:**
- Generally show **improved overall survival** compared to wild-type
- Median OS typically ranges from **24-36 months** in treated cohorts
- Significantly better prognosis when treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
- 5-year survival rates: approximately **15-20%**

**EGFR-Amplified Patients:**
- Show **intermediate survival outcomes**
- Median OS typically **18-24 months**
- Less responsive to EGFR TKIs compared to mutation-positive patients
- Amplification alone (without mutation) has less predictive value for targeted therapy

**EGFR Wild-Type Patients:**
- Generally **poorest outcomes** among the three groups when considering targeted therapy era
- Median OS: **12-18 months** with standard chemotherapy
- Do not benefit from EGFR TKI therapy
- May have better outcomes with immunotherapy approaches

## Key Clinical Considerations

1. **Treatment Response**: EGFR mutations (especially exon 19 deletions and L858R) predict strong response to TKIs
2. **Resistance Patterns**: T790M mutation develops in ~50-60% of EGFR-mutated patients, affecting subsequent survival
3. **Stage Dependency**: Survival differences are most pronounced in advanced-stage disease

**Note**: Specific survival statistics vary by study cohort, treatment era, and geographic population in cBioPortal datasets.
