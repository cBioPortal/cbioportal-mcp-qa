# Question 64

**Type:** Pan-Cancer Specificity Analysis

**Question:** Can you identify a mutations that are highly specific to a single cancer type? 

**Answer:**

# Mutations Highly Specific to Single Cancer Types

Based on the cBioPortal data, here are some notable mutations that show high specificity to particular cancer types:

## **BRAF V600E in Melanoma**
- Found in approximately 40-50% of melanomas
- Much less common in other cancer types (except some thyroid cancers)
- This mutation is a hallmark of melanoma and a key therapeutic target

## **IDH1 R132H in Gliomas**
- Highly specific to low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas
- Found in ~70-80% of grade II-III gliomas
- Rare in other cancer types

## **GNAQ/GNA11 mutations in Uveal Melanoma**
- Found in ~80-90% of uveal melanomas
- Extremely rare in other cancer types
- These mutations are mutually exclusive and highly specific to this rare eye cancer

## **SPOP mutations in Prostate Cancer**
- Found in ~10-15% of prostate cancers
- Very rare in other malignancies
- One of the most common mutations specific to prostate cancer

## **CTNNB1 mutations in Hepatocellular Carcinoma**
- Found in ~20-40% of liver cancers
- Less common in other cancer types
- Particularly associated with HCC pathogenesis

These cancer-type-specific mutations are valuable for diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy development.
