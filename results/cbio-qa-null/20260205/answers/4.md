# Question 4

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have direct access to the current cBioPortal database to query the exact number of primary samples in the MSK-CHORD Study. 

To find this information, you can:

1. Go to cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org)
2. Search for "MSK-CHORD" in the study selection page
3. Click on the study to view its details
4. The study summary page will show the total number of samples and specify how many are primary samples

Alternatively, if you're already on the study page, look for the sample composition breakdown which typically distinguishes between primary, metastatic, and other sample types.
