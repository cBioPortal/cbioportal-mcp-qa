# Question 68

**Type:** Cross-Cohort Comparison

**Question:** What are the key genomic differences between lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas identified in the Pan-Lung Cancer TCGA study?

**Answer:**

Based on the Pan-Lung Cancer TCGA study, several key genomic differences distinguish lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) from squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC):

## Major Genomic Alterations

**Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) specific features:**
- **EGFR mutations** (~14% of cases) - rare in LUSC
- **KRAS mutations** (~33% of cases) - significantly more common than in LUSC
- **ALK fusions** (~5% of cases) - virtually absent in LUSC
- **RET, ROS1, and NTRK fusions** - present in LUAD but rare/absent in LUSC
- **STK11/LKB1 mutations** - more frequent in LUAD

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) specific features:**
- **TP53 mutations** - nearly universal (~90%), higher than LUAD (~50%)
- **SOX2 amplification** - highly enriched in LUSC
- **PIK3CA mutations** - more common in LUSC (~16% vs ~5% in LUAD)
- **CDKN2A deletions** - more frequent in LUSC
- **FGFR1 amplification** - enriched in LUSC (~20%)
- **DDR2 mutations** - more common in LUSC

## Clinical Implications

These differences are clinically significant because:
- LUAD patients with EGFR mutations or ALK fusions can benefit from targeted therapies
- LUSC has fewer actionable driver mutations
- The genomic profiles reflect different cells of origin and pathogenesis pathways

This molecular distinction helps guide treatment selection and clinical trial design for lung cancer patients.
