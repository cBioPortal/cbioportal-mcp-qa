# Question 35

**Type:** Mutation Impact on Expression

**Question:** Do samples with TP53 truncating mutations have significantly lower TP53 mRNA expression compared to wild-type samples?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the specific dataset you're analyzing, but I can provide guidance on how to investigate this question in cBioPortal:

**How to analyze this in cBioPortal:**

1. **Select your study** and query for TP53 mutations and mRNA expression data

2. **Group samples by mutation type:**
   - TP53 truncating mutations (nonsense, frameshift, splice site)
   - TP53 wild-type samples

3. **Use the "Plots" or "Comparison" tab** to compare TP53 mRNA expression levels between groups

4. **Look for:**
   - Box plots showing expression distributions
   - Statistical tests (t-test, Mann-Whitney) with p-values
   - Median/mean expression values for each group

**Expected biological context:**

- **Truncating mutations** (nonsense, frameshift) often trigger **nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)**, which can lead to **lower mRNA levels**
- However, this is **not always the case** - it depends on:
  - The position of the mutation
  - Whether NMD is activated
  - The specific cancer type
  - Other regulatory mechanisms

**The answer varies by cancer type.** In some studies, truncating mutations do show lower expression, while in others there's no significant difference or even higher expression due to loss of negative feedback regulation.
