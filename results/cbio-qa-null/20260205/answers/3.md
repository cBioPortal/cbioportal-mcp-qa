# Question 3

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have specific information about the MSK-CHORD Study in my current context. To find this information, you would need to:

1. Go to the cBioPortal website
2. Search for "MSK-CHORD" in the study selection page
3. Select the study to view its details, which will show the number of patients and samples

Alternatively, if you have access to cBioPortal, you can look for this study in the cancer study list where the patient and sample counts are typically displayed in the study description.

If you can provide me with access to the study details or let me know if you're seeing this study in cBioPortal, I can help you interpret the information.
