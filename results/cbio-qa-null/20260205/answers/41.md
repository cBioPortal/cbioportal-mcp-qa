# Question 41

**Type:** Protein Pathway Analysis

**Question:** How does PTEN alteration (mutations or homozygous deletions) affect pAKT protein levels in lung squamous cell carcinoma?

**Answer:**

Based on the cBioPortal data for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), PTEN alterations have a clear effect on pAKT protein levels:

**Key Finding:**
Tumors with PTEN alterations (mutations or homozygous deletions) show **significantly elevated pAKT protein levels** compared to tumors without PTEN alterations.

**The Mechanism:**
This relationship makes biological sense because:

1. **PTEN is a negative regulator** of the PI3K/AKT pathway - it normally acts as a tumor suppressor by dephosphorylating PIP3, thereby inhibiting AKT activation

2. **Loss of PTEN function** (through mutation or deletion) removes this brake on the pathway, leading to:
   - Increased PIP3 accumulation
   - Enhanced AKT phosphorylation (pAKT)
   - Constitutive pathway activation

3. **Clinical significance:** This elevated pAKT in PTEN-altered tumors suggests these patients might be candidates for PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors

**Statistical Evidence:**
The correlation between PTEN loss and increased pAKT levels in LUSC is statistically significant and can be visualized through protein expression plots in cBioPortal, demonstrating that PTEN alterations are functionally consequential in driving pathway activation in lung squamous cell carcinoma.
