How many studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM Output states it doesn't have access to real-time data and cannot provide a specific number. However, the Expected Answer is 516 studies, which should have been retrievable from the cBioPortal database context. The output is factually incorrect in claiming it cannot answer when the answer exists.",1,"The output completely fails to answer the question. Instead of providing the number of studies (516), it deflects by saying it doesn't have access to the data and provides instructions on how the user could find the answer themselves. This does not address the user's direct question.",1,"The output is excessively verbose for a simple numerical question. It provides unnecessary instructions about visiting websites, using APIs, and checking data pages when a simple number would suffice. The answer should have been a single sentence stating there are 516 studies.",1,"The output fails to use the provided Context/Source (cBioPortal database) which contains the answer. Instead, it relies on general knowledge about cBioPortal's website and API structure, and makes claims about not having access to data when the context should have provided this information. It introduces external information rather than querying or using the provided database context.",40,180,5.091891180025414
How many glioblastoma studies are in cBioPortal?,1,"The LLM Output states there are 'around 15-20 glioblastoma-related studies' in cBioPortal, but the Expected Answer is 7. This is a significant factual error, with the LLM providing a number that is more than double the correct answer.",3,The output does address the question directly by providing a numerical answer (albeit incorrect) and even goes beyond by listing specific study examples and providing guidance on how to verify the information.,1,"The output is excessively verbose for a simple counting question. It includes unnecessary details such as a list of 6 specific studies, recommendations for verification, and explanations about what might be included in the count. A simple numerical answer would have been sufficient.",1,"The LLM Output appears to rely heavily on external knowledge or hallucination rather than the provided cBioPortal database context. It provides specific study names, publication details, and sample counts that are not verifiable from the stated context, and most critically, provides an incorrect count that contradicts the expected answer from the database.",45,304,6.155131504056044
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output does not provide the correct answer. The expected answer is '24,950 Patients and 25,040 samples', but the LLM states it doesn't have this information and provides generic instructions instead.",1,"The LLM Output completely fails to answer the question. Instead of providing the patient and sample counts, it explains how to find this information, which does not address what was asked.",1,"The output is excessively verbose for a question that requires a simple numerical answer. It provides unnecessary instructions on how to navigate cBioPortal and offers conditional help, when a direct answer was expected.",2,"While the LLM doesn't hallucinate false information, it fails to use the available context (cbioportal database) to retrieve the answer. It provides general knowledge about how to use cBioPortal rather than accessing the specific data that should be available in the context.",44,158,3.9642092309659347
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output does not provide the correct answer. The expected answer is '15,928 primary samples', but the LLM states it doesn't have access to the information and provides no numerical answer.",1,"The LLM Output completely fails to answer the question. Instead of providing the number of primary samples, it explains how the user could find this information themselves, which does not address the question asked.",1,The output is excessively verbose for a question that requires a simple numerical answer. It provides unnecessary instructions on how to navigate cBioPortal rather than directly answering the question.,2,"While the LLM doesn't hallucinate false information, it claims not to have access to the cBioPortal database when the context indicates it should be able to query this information. The response relies on the assumption that it cannot access the source, rather than attempting to use the provided context.",43,151,3.5673482679994777
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM Output states it doesn't have access to the treatment information, but the expected answer is 'Fluorouracil', indicating this information was available in the context. The output is factually incorrect in claiming the information is unavailable.",1,"The output completely fails to answer the question. Instead of providing the treatment information (Fluorouracil), it states the information is not available and provides instructions on how to find it.",2,"While the response is structured, it includes unnecessary instructions on how to access cBioPortal and find the information manually, which is not needed when the answer should have been directly provided.",1,"The LLM incorrectly claims it doesn't have access to the information from the provided context, when the expected answer indicates this information was present in the source. This represents a failure to utilize the available context rather than hallucination, but still scores low on faithfulness to the source material.",44,130,4.09898870694451
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,1,"The LLM output is factually incorrect. The expected answer shows TP53 at 22.4%, but the LLM claims approximately 90%. The other genes listed (RB1, DLG2, PTEN) do not match the expected answer at all (which includes MUC16, TTN, ATRX, DNAH9). Only TP53 and ATRX appear in both lists, but with vastly different frequencies.",3,"The output does provide a complete answer to the question by listing 5 genes with their mutation frequencies, even though the specific genes and frequencies are incorrect.",2,"The answer includes some unnecessary elaboration about TP53 and RB1's roles in osteosarcoma pathogenesis, and adds a disclaimer about dataset variations. While informative, this goes beyond what was asked for in a straightforward frequency query.",1,The LLM output does not faithfully represent the cBioPortal database information. The expected answer from the actual database shows completely different frequencies and mostly different genes. The LLM appears to have generated this answer from general knowledge about osteosarcoma rather than querying or accurately representing the specific TARGET study data.,53,224,4.221148503944278
