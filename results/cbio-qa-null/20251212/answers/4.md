# Question 4

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to specific treatment data for the MSK-CHORD Study in my current knowledge base. To find information about the most common treatments received by patients in this study, I'd recommend:

1. **Checking the study details in cBioPortal**: Navigate to the MSK-CHORD study page where treatment information may be displayed in the clinical data or study description.

2. **Reviewing the associated publication**: Look for the primary publication linked to this dataset, which would typically describe the patient cohort and treatment details.

3. **Examining the clinical data tab**: In cBioPortal, you can often find treatment information in the clinical data section for individual patients or as summary statistics.

Could you check these resources in cBioPortal, or would you like me to help you navigate to find this specific information about patient treatments in the MSK-CHORD Study?
