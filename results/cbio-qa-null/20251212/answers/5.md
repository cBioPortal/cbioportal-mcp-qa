# Question 5

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to real-time data from cBioPortal to provide the current top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study. To find this information, you would need to:

1. Go to cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.org)
2. Search for "TARGET" and select the Osteosarcoma study
3. Navigate to the "Mutations" tab or use the "Plots" feature
4. Sort genes by mutation frequency to see the most commonly mutated genes

Alternatively, you could:
- Use the "Cancer Types Summary" view to see mutation frequencies across genes
- Check the study's summary page which often highlights key findings
- Look at the publication associated with the TARGET Osteosarcoma dataset for reported frequently mutated genes

If you're currently on cBioPortal, I'd be happy to help guide you through the specific steps to find this information in the interface.
