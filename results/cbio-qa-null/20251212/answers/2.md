# Question 2

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the current data for the MSK-CHORD Study in cBioPortal. To find the number of patients and samples in this study, I recommend:

1. **Search directly in cBioPortal**: Go to www.cbioportal.org and use the search function to look for "MSK-CHORD"

2. **Check the study page**: Once you find the study, the main study page will display the total number of patients and samples at the top

3. **Browse studies**: You can also browse all available studies and look for MSK-CHORD in the list

The study summary page will show you the exact counts for both patients and samples, along with other key information about the dataset such as cancer types included and data types available.
