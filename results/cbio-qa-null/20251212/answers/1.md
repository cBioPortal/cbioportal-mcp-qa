# Question 1

**Type:** Data Discovery

**Question:** How many studies are in cBioPortal?

**Answer:**

I don't have access to the current real-time count of studies in cBioPortal, as this number changes regularly as new datasets are added and existing ones are updated.

To find the current number of studies, you can:

1. **Visit the cBioPortal homepage** (www.cbioportal.org) - the total number of studies is typically displayed on the main page

2. **Go to the "Data Sets" or "Studies" page** - this will show you a complete list of all available studies with the current count

3. **Use the API** - you can query the cBioPortal web API endpoint `/api/studies` to get the programmatic count

As of my last knowledge update, cBioPortal contained several hundred cancer studies, but I'd recommend checking the website directly for the most current and accurate number.
