How many studies are in cBioPortal?,2,"The output correctly identifies that cBioPortal contains study information and that the homepage displays statistics, but it doesn't provide the actual number of studies, which was the specific question asked.",1,"The output fails to provide the actual number of studies in cBioPortal. Instead, it redirects the user to find the information themselves on the homepage, which doesn't answer the direct question.",1,"The output is excessively verbose with unnecessary formatting, metadata, and explanatory text when a simple number would have sufficed to answer the question.",3,"The output relies only on the provided context (cBioPortal database and URL). It doesn't introduce external information or hallucinate specific numbers, instead appropriately directing to the source."
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM provides a URL that appears to be incorrect. The expected answer shows 'msk_chord_2024' while the LLM output shows 'chord_msk_2022', suggesting either an outdated or incorrect study identifier.",1,"The LLM does not provide the actual patient and sample counts requested in the question. Instead, it only directs the user to a webpage where they might find this information, failing to answer the specific question asked.",2,"The response includes unnecessary formatting and metadata (Question 2, Type designation, Model Information section, timestamp) that don't contribute to answering the core question, making it somewhat verbose.",2,"While the LLM attempts to use the cbioportal database as specified in the context, it provides a different URL than the expected answer, suggesting it may be drawing from outdated or incorrect information rather than strictly following the provided source."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,1,"The LLM provided an incorrect URL (chord_msk_2022) compared to the expected URL (msk_chord_2024), indicating it may be referencing the wrong study or version. This is a significant factual error.",1,"The LLM did not provide the actual number of primary samples, which was the specific information requested. Instead, it only directed the user to a webpage without answering the question.",2,"The response includes some unnecessary formatting and explanatory text about where to find the information, but the core message is reasonably direct. The model information section is standard metadata.",2,"While the LLM attempts to use the cbioportal database as specified in the context, it provides a different URL than expected, suggesting it may be drawing from external knowledge or making assumptions about the correct study identifier."
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The URL provided is incorrect (chord_msk_2022 vs expected msk_chord_2024), but the general guidance about finding treatment information on cBioPortal is accurate.",1,"The output does not answer the specific question about what treatment most patients received. Instead, it redirects the user to find the information themselves without providing the actual answer.",1,"The output is excessively verbose with unnecessary formatting, headers, and metadata. It includes irrelevant information like model details and timestamps that don't help answer the question.",2,"While the output references the cBioPortal database as specified in the context, it provides an incorrect URL and includes external knowledge about cBioPortal's interface features that wasn't provided in the context."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM provides a URL that appears to be correctly formatted for cBioPortal and references the TARGET osteosarcoma study, but it doesn't actually provide the specific top 5 genes as requested. The URL structure looks appropriate for accessing mutation data.",1,"The LLM completely fails to answer the actual question. Instead of listing the top 5 most frequently mutated genes, it only provides a URL and instructions on how to find the information. The user asked for specific gene names, not directions to find them.",2,"The response includes unnecessary formatting elements like 'Question 5', 'Type: Genomic Alteration Frequencies', and model information that don't contribute to answering the question. However, the core explanation is reasonably direct.",3,The response stays within the bounds of the provided context (cBioPortal database) and doesn't introduce external information or hallucinations. It correctly references the TARGET osteosarcoma study and cBioPortal's interface.
