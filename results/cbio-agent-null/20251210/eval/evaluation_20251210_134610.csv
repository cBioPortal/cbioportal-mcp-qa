How many studies are in cBioPortal?,2,"The output correctly identifies that cBioPortal displays study counts on its homepage, but it doesn't provide the actual number of studies, which was the specific question asked.",1,"The output fails to provide the actual number of studies in cBioPortal. Instead, it only directs the user to find this information themselves on the website.",1,"The output is excessively verbose with unnecessary formatting, metadata, and explanatory text when a simple number would have sufficed for the question asked.",3,The output relies only on the provided context/source (cBioPortal database and URL) without introducing external information or hallucinations.
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM provides a URL that appears to be incorrect. The expected answer shows 'msk_chord_2024' while the LLM output shows 'chord_msk_2022', suggesting either an outdated or incorrect study identifier.",1,"The LLM does not provide the actual patient and sample counts requested in the question. Instead, it only directs the user to a webpage without answering the specific numerical question asked.",2,"The response includes some unnecessary formatting and metadata, but the core answer is reasonably direct in explaining that the user needs to visit the URL for the information.",2,"While the LLM attempts to use the cbioportal database as specified in the context, it provides a different URL than the expected answer, suggesting it may be drawing from outdated or incorrect information rather than strictly following the provided source."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The LLM provided a URL that differs from the expected answer URL. The LLM used 'chord_msk_2022' while the expected answer shows 'msk_chord_2024', indicating a potential error in the study identifier or year.",1,"The LLM did not provide the actual number of primary samples, which was the specific question asked. Instead, it only directed the user to a webpage where they would need to find this information themselves.",2,"The response includes some unnecessary formatting and explanatory text about where to find the information on the page, when a direct answer with the number would have been more appropriate.",2,"While the LLM correctly identified that this information should be found on cbioportal, it provided a different URL than what was given in the expected answer, suggesting some deviation from the provided source information."
What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,2,"The URL provided is incorrect (chord_msk_2022 vs expected msk_chord_2024), but the general guidance about finding treatment information on cBioPortal is accurate.",1,"The output does not answer the specific question about what treatment most patients received. Instead, it redirects the user to find the information themselves without providing the actual answer.",1,"The output is excessively verbose with unnecessary formatting, headers, and metadata. It includes irrelevant information like model details and timestamps that don't help answer the question.",2,"While the output references the cBioPortal database as specified in the context, it provides an incorrect URL and adds external knowledge about cBioPortal's interface features that weren't mentioned in the source."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,2,"The LLM provides a URL that appears to be correctly formatted for cBioPortal and references the TARGET osteosarcoma study, but it doesn't actually provide the specific top 5 genes as requested. The URL structure seems appropriate for accessing mutation data.",1,"The LLM completely fails to answer the actual question. Instead of listing the top 5 most frequently mutated genes, it only provides a URL and instructions on how to find the information. The question asks for specific gene names, not directions to find them.",2,"The response includes unnecessary formatting elements like 'Question 5', 'Type: Genomic Alteration Frequencies', and model information that don't contribute to answering the question. However, the core explanation is reasonably direct.",3,The response stays within the bounds of the provided context (cBioPortal database) and doesn't introduce external information or hallucinations. It correctly references the TARGET osteosarcoma study and cBioPortal's interface.
