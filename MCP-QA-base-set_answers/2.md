# Question 2

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Based on my query of the cBioPortal database, here are the numbers for the MSK-CHORD Study:

**MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)**
- **Patients**: 24,950
- **Samples**: 25,040

This study contains targeted sequencing data from 25,040 tumors from 24,950 patients and their matched normals via MSK-IMPACT, along with clinical annotations. The study was published in Nature 2024 and represents one of the largest cancer genomics datasets in cBioPortal.

The slight difference between patient and sample counts (25,040 samples vs 24,950 patients) indicates that some patients have multiple samples in the study.
