# Question 5

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes**:

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Mutated Samples | Total Mutations | Frequency (%) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1    | **TP53**    | 32              | 33              | 22.7%         |
| 2    | **TTN**     | 16              | 18              | 11.3%         |
| 3    | **MUC16**   | 16              | 17              | 11.3%         |
| 4    | **ATRX**    | 11              | 11              | 7.8%          |
| 5    | **DNAH9**   | 10              | 10              | 7.1%          |

**Key findings:**

- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in 32 out of 141 samples (22.7%), which is consistent with TP53's role as a critical tumor suppressor gene frequently altered in various cancers including osteosarcoma.

- **TTN** (Titin) and **MUC16** (Mucin 16) are tied for second place, each mutated in 16 samples (11.3%). TTN is a large protein and often appears in mutation lists due to its size, while MUC16 mutations may have functional significance.

- **ATRX** (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked) is mutated in 11 samples (7.8%), which is notable as ATRX alterations are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres in sarcomas.

- **DNAH9** (Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain 9) rounds out the top 5 with mutations in 10 samples (7.1%).

The analysis is based on 141 samples with mutation data in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study from the GDC.
