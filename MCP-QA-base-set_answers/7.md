# Question 7

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TCGA breast cancer data, here are the key findings:

## Most Frequent TP53 Mutation in TCGA Breast Cancer

**The most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene across TCGA breast cancer studies is R175H**, a missense mutation that occurs 83 times across all five TCGA breast cancer datasets.

### Top TP53 Mutations in TCGA Breast Cancer:

1. **R175H (Missense)** - 83 total occurrences
2. **R273H (Missense)** - 48 total occurrences  
3. **R196* (Nonsense)** - 38 total occurrences
4. **H193R (Missense)** - 30 total occurrences
5. **R342* (Nonsense)** - 30 total occurrences

### Context:
- The analysis includes data from 5 TCGA breast cancer studies
- The largest study (TCGA PanCancer Atlas 2018) has 347 samples with TP53 mutations
- R175H appears consistently across all 5 studies, making it the most recurrent TP53 mutation
- This mutation affects a critical residue in the DNA-binding domain of p53

The R175H mutation is a well-known hotspot mutation in TP53 that disrupts the protein's ability to bind DNA and function as a tumor suppressor, which is consistent with its high frequency in breast cancer.
