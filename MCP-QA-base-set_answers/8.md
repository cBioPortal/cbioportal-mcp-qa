# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** How many patients have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma (PanCancer Atlas) study, I found:

**26 patients have EGFR amplification** in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study.

Key details:
- Study: TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma (PanCancer Atlas) - `luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`
- Total patients in study: 566
- Patients with EGFR amplification (CNA value = +2): 26
- This represents approximately 4.6% of patients in the study

The amplifications are defined as copy number alteration (CNA) value of +2, which is the standard threshold for amplification in cBioPortal. No patients had higher-level amplifications (>+2) for EGFR in this dataset.
