# Question 6

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the Pediatric Neuroblastoma (TARGET, 2018) study, here are the results:

**Fraction of patients older than 5 years at diagnosis: 0.116 (11.6%)**

**Details:**
- Total patients with age data: 1,076
- Patients older than 5 years at diagnosis: 125
- Fraction: 125/1,076 = 0.116 or 11.6%

This means that approximately **88.4%** of patients in the TARGET Pediatric Neuroblastoma study were 5 years old or younger when diagnosed, which is consistent with neuroblastoma being primarily a pediatric cancer that typically affects very young children, with the majority of cases occurring in infants and toddlers.
