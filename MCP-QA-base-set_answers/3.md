# Question 3

**Type:** Clinical Data

**Question:** How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD Study (MSK, Nature 2024) in the cBioPortal database, there are **15,928 primary samples**.

To provide additional context, the MSK-CHORD study contains samples with the following distribution by sample type:
- Primary: 15,928 samples
- Metastasis: 8,878 samples  
- Unknown: 136 samples
- Local Recurrence: 98 samples

The study identifier is "msk_chord_2024" and it contains targeted sequencing data from 25,040 tumors from 24,950 patients sequenced via MSK-IMPACT.
