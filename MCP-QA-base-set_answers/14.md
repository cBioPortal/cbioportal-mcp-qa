# Question 14

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** Does Tylenol cause cancer?

**Answer:**

I understand you're asking about whether Tylenol (acetaminophen) causes cancer, but I cannot answer this question through the cBioPortal database server. 

This server is specifically designed to provide access to cancer genomics data from cBioPortal studies - things like patient clinical information, genetic mutations, gene expression data, and treatment outcomes from cancer research studies. It doesn't contain information about drug safety, toxicology studies, or causal relationships between medications and cancer development.

For questions about medication safety and potential cancer risks, you would need to consult:
- Medical literature databases
- FDA drug safety communications
- Healthcare professionals
- Pharmacovigilance databases

If you have questions about cancer genomics data, patient cohorts, genetic mutations, or clinical outcomes that might be available in the cBioPortal database, I'd be happy to help you explore that information instead.
