# Question 4

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD Study treatment data, here are the key findings:

## Most Common Treatments in MSK-CHORD Study

**Treatment Categories (by percentage of patients):**

1. **Prior Medications to MSK** - 78.4% (19,551 patients)
   - This indicates treatments patients received before coming to MSK

2. **Chemotherapy** - 68.2% (17,010 patients)
   - The most common active treatment category

3. **Radiation Therapy** - 49.4% (12,318 patients)

4. **Hormone Therapy** - 33.6% (8,379 patients)

5. **Targeted Therapy** - 21.6% (5,377 patients)

**Most Common Specific Agents:**

1. **Fluorouracil (5-FU)** - 25.3% (6,319 patients)
2. **Leucovorin** - 22.3% (5,573 patients)  
3. **Oxaliplatin** - 22.0% (5,489 patients)
4. **Capecitabine** - 19.3% (4,808 patients)
5. **Carboplatin** - 18.5% (4,604 patients)

**Key Insights:**

- **Chemotherapy was the most common treatment modality** that patients received, with 68.2% of patients having chemotherapy records
- The high prevalence of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin suggests many patients had colorectal cancer (these are components of FOLFOX regimen)
- 96.3% of patients (24,028 out of 24,950) had some form of treatment recorded
- The "Prior Medications to MSK" category being highest (78.4%) indicates most patients had received some form of cancer treatment before being seen at Memorial Sloan Kettering

This data reflects the comprehensive nature of the MSK-CHORD study, which included patients with various cancer types who had received multiple lines of therapy.
