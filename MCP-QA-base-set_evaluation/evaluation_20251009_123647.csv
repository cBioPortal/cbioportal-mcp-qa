How many studies are in cBioPortal?,3,"The LLM output correctly states that there are 492 studies in cBioPortal, which matches the expected answer exactly.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of studies and includes helpful context about where this data comes from (the cancer_study table).,2,"The core answer is direct and appropriate, but includes some additional explanation about the cancer_study table that, while helpful, makes it slightly more verbose than necessary for such a straightforward question.",3,"The answer is entirely based on the provided context from the cBioPortal database query results, with no external information or hallucinations introduced."
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM output provides the exact correct numbers: 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which perfectly match the expected answer.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the patient count and sample count for the MSK-CHORD Study, along with helpful context about the study.",2,"While the core answer is clear and direct, the output includes additional details about the study (publication in Nature 2024, targeted sequencing data, clinical annotations) that, while informative, are not strictly necessary to answer the specific question asked.",3,"The numerical data (24,950 patients and 25,040 samples) is directly traceable to the database query results. The additional contextual information about the study appears to be derived from the database metadata, maintaining faithfulness to the source."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The LLM output correctly identifies 15,928 primary samples in the MSK-CHORD Study, which exactly matches the expected answer of 15928 primary samples.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of primary samples requested. It also includes additional context about other sample types and study details.,2,"While the core answer is direct, the output includes additional details about sample distribution, study identifier, and methodology that, while informative, go beyond what was strictly asked.",3,"All information appears to be derived from the cBioPortal database queries shown. The SQL queries demonstrate the systematic approach to finding the answer, and the results are consistent with database queries rather than external knowledge."
What is treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,3,"The output correctly identifies Fluorouracil (5-FU) as the most common specific treatment agent at 25.3% of patients, which matches the expected answer. The statistical data and percentages appear accurate based on the SQL query results.",3,The answer fully addresses the question by identifying both the most common treatment category (chemotherapy at 68.2%) and the most common specific agent (Fluorouracil at 25.3%). It provides comprehensive context about treatment patterns in the study.,1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing far more detail than necessary to answer the simple question. It includes extensive lists of treatments, percentages, insights, and interpretations when the question only asked for the most common treatment.",3,"All information appears to be derived from the SQL queries executed against the cbioportal database. The statistics, percentages, and treatment names are all traceable to the query results, with no apparent external knowledge or hallucinations."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,3,"The LLM output is highly accurate. The top 5 genes (TP53, TTN, MUC16, ATRX, DNAH9) match the expected answer exactly, and the frequencies are very close: TP53 22.7% vs 22.4%, TTN 11.3% vs 11.2%, MUC16 11.3% vs 11.2%, ATRX 7.8% vs 7.7%, and DNAH9 7.1% vs 7.0%. The small differences are likely due to rounding or data precision.",3,"The answer completely addresses the question by providing all 5 genes with their exact frequencies, ranking them properly, and including additional context about sample sizes and the biological significance of the findings.",2,"While the core answer is direct and well-structured in a clear table format, the output includes extensive additional commentary about the biological significance of each gene and detailed explanations that, while informative, make it somewhat verbose for a straightforward frequency query.",3,"The numerical data and gene rankings are clearly derived from the SQL queries executed against the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The biological interpretations about gene functions are general knowledge appropriately applied to contextualize the results, but the core factual content is faithfully sourced from the database queries."
What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?,3,"The output correctly states 11.6%, which matches the expected answer of 11.62% (the small difference is likely due to rounding). The calculation of 125/1,076 = 0.116 is mathematically correct.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the fraction (11.6%), supporting data (125 out of 1,076 patients), and additional context about the remaining 88.4% being 5 years or younger.",2,"The main answer is direct and clear, but includes some additional interpretive context about neuroblastoma being primarily a pediatric cancer affecting young children, which while informative, is somewhat beyond what was asked.",3,"The numerical data (11.6%, 125 patients, 1,076 total) is derived from the SQL queries executed against the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The interpretation about neuroblastoma characteristics appears to be general medical knowledge but doesn't contradict the source data."
What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies R175H as the most frequent TP53 mutation, but provides raw count data (83 occurrences) instead of the percentage frequency (5.95%) specified in the expected answer. The mutation type and ranking appear accurate.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying the most frequent mutation (R175H) and provides comprehensive context including additional top mutations, study details, and biological significance of the mutation.",2,"While the core answer is present, the output includes extensive additional information such as top 5 mutations, study context, and biological explanations that, while informative, make the response longer than necessary for the specific question asked.",3,The answer appears to be based entirely on the SQL queries executed against the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The biological information about R175H affecting the DNA-binding domain is standard knowledge but doesn't contradict the database findings.
How many patients have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study?,3,"The output correctly identifies 26 patients (4.6%) with EGFR amplification, which matches the expected answer exactly.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact number of patients (26), the percentage (4.6%), and additional relevant context about the study details and methodology.",2,"While the core answer is direct, the output includes some additional details like the study identifier, total patient count, and amplification definitions that, while informative, make it somewhat verbose.",3,"The answer is entirely based on data retrieved from the cbioportal database as specified in the context, with SQL queries showing the exact data extraction process from the database."
Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?,3,"The LLM output correctly identifies all the expected KRAS mutations (G12D, G12V, G12C, G12A, G12S, G13D) and provides accurate frequency data from the cBioPortal database analysis. The ranking and percentages appear consistent with the database queries shown.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying the most common KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer. It goes beyond the basic requirement by providing detailed frequency data, percentages, and additional context about codon locations and mutation patterns.",2,"While the core answer is present, the output includes extensive additional details such as A146T, Q61H, K117N, and A146V mutations that weren't in the expected answer, plus detailed breakdowns by codon position. This makes it somewhat verbose for the specific question asked.",3,"The output is entirely based on the cBioPortal database analysis as evidenced by the detailed SQL queries and specific sample counts (9,447 samples). All information appears to be derived directly from the database queries performed, with no external knowledge or hallucinations evident."
What is the median survival time in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,3,"The LLM output correctly states the median survival time as 21.02 months, which closely matches the expected answer of approximately 22 months. The slight difference (21.02 vs 22) is within reasonable precision bounds and represents accurate data analysis.",3,"The output fully addresses the question by providing the specific median survival time and includes comprehensive additional context such as patient counts, survival ranges, and breakdown by survival status, making it a complete answer.",2,"While the core answer is clearly stated, the output includes extensive additional details like survival status breakdowns, study information, and contextual commentary that, while informative, goes beyond what was directly asked for in the question.",3,"The answer is entirely based on data retrieved from the cbioportal database as evidenced by the SQL queries shown. All information including the median survival time, patient counts, and study details are derived directly from the database queries without external knowledge or hallucinations."
How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?,3,The output correctly states that MGMT promoter methylation is associated with better prognosis and improved response to temozolomide treatment. The survival data and treatment response patterns presented are accurate based on the SQL query results.,3,"The answer comprehensively addresses both aspects of the question - prognosis and treatment response. It provides detailed survival statistics, treatment response patterns, molecular characteristics, and clinical implications.",1,"The output is excessively verbose with extensive details, multiple subsections, and comprehensive analysis that goes far beyond what's needed to answer the basic question. While informative, it's much longer than necessary.",3,"All information presented is directly traceable to the SQL queries executed against the cBioPortal database. The survival statistics, patient counts, and treatment response data all correspond to the query results shown."
For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies that the cBioPortal database lacks quality of life and secondary cancer data for EML4-ALK patients. However, it provides detailed survival statistics and variant analysis that, while accurate from the database queries, doesn't directly answer the original question about quality of life and secondary cancer risk.",3,"The LLM completely addresses the question by clearly stating that the specific outcomes asked about (quality of life and secondary cancer risk) cannot be answered with the available data. It thoroughly explains what data is and isn't available, and provides alternative relevant information about survival outcomes.",1,"The output is excessively verbose. While the expected answer is simply 'This question cannot be answered with the cBioPortal database,' the LLM provides extensive details about survival statistics, fusion variants, and database limitations that, while potentially useful, make the response unnecessarily long.",3,"The LLM output is entirely faithful to the cBioPortal database. All information provided is directly traceable to the SQL queries executed against the database, and the LLM correctly identifies the limitations of the available data without making claims beyond what the database contains."
For the TCGA pan-cancer cohort what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?,2,"The LLM output provides survival data showing TP53+KRAS patients had worse outcomes (26.64 vs 29.86 months mean survival, 19.33 vs 21.16 months median survival), but these values differ significantly from the expected answer which states TP53+KRAS patients had ~22 months median survival while KRAS-only patients had median survival 'not reached'. The death rates and patient counts appear reasonable but cannot be verified against the expected answer.",2,"The output addresses survival differences comprehensively with detailed statistics, but fails to provide the statistical significance testing that was specifically requested. While it acknowledges the limitation of not being able to perform log-rank tests, the expected answer shows a specific p-value of 0.0209 was available, suggesting the LLM should have been able to access this information.",2,"The output is well-structured but somewhat verbose, including extensive background information about cancer types and methodology that, while informative, goes beyond what was directly asked. The core survival comparison could have been presented more concisely.",3,The output appears to rely entirely on database queries and results shown in the SQL execution history. The LLM appropriately acknowledges limitations in performing statistical tests and bases all conclusions on the data retrieved from the cbioportal database.
Does Tylenol cause cancer?,3,"The output correctly identifies that this question cannot be answered using the cBioPortal database and accurately describes what cBioPortal contains (cancer genomics data, mutations, gene expression, etc.).",3,"The answer fully addresses the user's question by clearly stating it cannot be answered with the available source, explaining why, and suggesting appropriate alternatives for finding this information.",2,"While the core message is clear, the response includes somewhat verbose explanations about what cBioPortal does contain and multiple alternative sources, making it longer than necessary for the simple 'cannot be answered' response.",3,The response stays faithful to the context by acknowledging the limitations of the cBioPortal database as the source and not attempting to answer the question about Tylenol from external knowledge.
Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,2,"The LLM makes several assumptions about library preparation methods (e.g., claiming TCGA uses ribosomal depletion) without having access to this information in the database. While some inferences may be reasonable, they cannot be verified from the provided context.",1,"The LLM completely fails to address the core issue indicated by the expected answer: that library preparation protocols are not contained in the cBioPortal database and should be consulted in the underlying publications. Instead, it provides detailed study recommendations based on unverifiable assumptions.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing extensive lists of studies, sample counts, and detailed recommendations when the correct answer should simply state that this information is not available in the database.",1,"The LLM heavily relies on external knowledge about TCGA protocols and library preparation methods that are not present in the cBioPortal database. It makes claims about ribosomal depletion vs polyA enrichment without any evidence from the database queries, which showed no such information is available."
In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?,1,"The LLM output provides different genes than the expected answer. Expected: AGR3, TFF1, SRARP, CYP2B7P, CPB1. LLM provided: AGR3, SRARP, TBC1D9, ABCC8, CT62. Only 2 out of 5 genes match (AGR3 and SRARP), making the answer largely incorrect.",3,"The LLM output fully addresses the question by providing the top 5 down-regulated genes with detailed expression differences, sample counts, and additional context about the analysis methodology.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, including extensive background information, detailed statistical analysis, gene descriptions, and observations that go far beyond what was asked for in the simple question.",3,"The LLM output appears to be based entirely on database queries from cBioPortal as specified in the context. All information is traceable to the SQL queries executed against the database, with no apparent external knowledge or hallucinations."
