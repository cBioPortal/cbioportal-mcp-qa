The SQL queries show direct database access to the TARGET Osteosarcoma study, and all numerical results are derived from this source. No external knowledge appears to have been used for the core data."
What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?,3,"The output correctly states that 11.6% of patients were older than 5 years at diagnosis, which matches the expected answer of 11.62% (the slight difference is due to rounding).",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact fraction (0.116 or 11.6%), the raw numbers (125 out of 1,076 patients), and additional context about the study population.",2,"While the core answer is direct, the output includes additional contextual information about neuroblastoma being primarily a pediatric cancer affecting young children, which, while relevant, goes beyond what was specifically asked.",3,The numerical answer (11.6%) is directly derived from the SQL queries executed against the cbioportal database. The additional context about neuroblastoma typically affecting young children is consistent with the data findings and doesn't appear to rely on external sources.
What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies R175H as the most frequent TP53 mutation, which matches the expected answer. However, it provides absolute counts (83 occurrences) rather than the percentage (5.95%) specified in the expected answer, making it partially accurate in terms of how the frequency is reported.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying the most frequent mutation (R175H) and provides comprehensive context including rankings of other frequent mutations, study details, and biological significance of the mutation.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing far more detail than necessary to answer the specific question. It includes extensive rankings, context about multiple studies, biological explanations, and formatting that goes well beyond what was asked.",3,"The answer appears to be based entirely on the cbioportal database queries shown, with all information traceable to the SQL query results from the TCGA breast cancer datasets. No external knowledge or hallucinations are evident."

Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?,3,"The LLM output correctly identifies the most common KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer. All six mutations from the expected answer (G12D, G12V, G12C, G12A, G12S, G13D) are present in the top rankings, with accurate frequency data and percentages based on the cBioPortal database analysis.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying all the most common KRAS mutations expected in the answer. It goes beyond the basic requirement by providing detailed frequency data, percentages, and additional context about codon distribution patterns.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing far more detail than necessary to answer the simple question. While comprehensive, it includes extensive statistical breakdowns, additional mutations beyond what was asked, and detailed analysis that makes the core answer difficult to extract quickly.",3,"The answer is entirely based on the cBioPortal database as specified in the context. All data, statistics, and conclusions are derived from the SQL queries executed against the database, with no external information or hallucinations present."
What is the median survival time in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,3,"The LLM output correctly identifies the median survival time as 21.02 months, which closely matches the expected answer of approximately 22 months. The slight difference is likely due to data precision and is within acceptable range.",3,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the median survival time and includes comprehensive additional details such as patient counts, survival ranges, and study information that enhance understanding.",2,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the output includes extensive additional details like survival status breakdowns, study metadata, and contextual information that, while valuable, make it somewhat verbose for a straightforward question about median survival time.",3,"The answer is entirely based on data retrieved from the cbioportal database as evidenced by the SQL queries. All information provided can be traced back to the database queries executed, with no external knowledge or hallucinations present."
How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?,3,The output correctly states that MGMT promoter methylation leads to better prognosis and enhanced response to temozolomide treatment. The specific survival data and treatment response patterns are accurately presented based on the database queries.,3,"The answer comprehensively addresses both aspects of the question - prognosis (survival outcomes) and treatment response (response to temozolomide-based therapy). It provides detailed survival statistics, treatment response patterns, and clinical implications.",1,"The output is excessively verbose with extensive statistical details, multiple subsections, and repetitive information. While comprehensive, it could be much more concise while still answering the core question effectively.",3,"All information presented is directly derived from the cBioPortal database queries shown in the SQL section. The survival statistics, treatment response data, and molecular characteristics are all traceable to the database analysis performed."
For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,3,The LLM correctly identifies that the cBioPortal database lacks the specific data needed to answer questions about quality of life and secondary cancer risk. The survival data presented appears accurate based on the SQL queries executed.,3,"The output completely addresses the question by clearly explaining what data is and isn't available in cBioPortal, providing relevant survival data that was found, and explicitly stating the limitations for answering the specific questions about quality of life and secondary cancer risk.",1,"The output is excessively verbose and could be much more concise. While it correctly identifies that the question cannot be answered with cBioPortal data, it provides extensive survival analysis and detailed breakdowns that, while potentially interesting, are not directly relevant to the specific questions asked about quality of life and secondary cancer risk.",3,"The output relies entirely on data from the cBioPortal database as evidenced by the extensive SQL queries. All statistical information and conclusions are traceable to the database queries performed, with no external knowledge or hallucinations present."
For the TCGA pan-cancer cohort what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?,1,"The LLM output provides significantly different survival data than the expected answer. The expected answer states that patients with both mutations had ~22 months median survival while KRAS-only patients had median survival 'not reached', but the LLM reports 19.33 months vs 21.16 months respectively. Most critically, the LLM fails to provide the statistical significance (p-value = 0.0209) that was specifically requested.",1,"The output fails to address the key component of the question - statistical significance. While it provides survival differences, it explicitly states it cannot perform statistical significance testing and does not provide the p-value (0.0209) that should be available from the cbioportal database.",1,"The output is excessively verbose with unnecessary sections like detailed cancer type breakdowns, extensive formatting, and lengthy explanations about statistical limitations. The core answer could be delivered much more concisely.",2,"While the LLM appears to derive its survival statistics from database queries, the specific numbers don't match the expected answer from the same source (cbioportal), suggesting either different query parameters or data processing. The LLM stays within the database context but may have accessed different subsets of the data."
Does Tylenol cause cancer?,3,"The output correctly identifies that this question cannot be answered using the cBioPortal database and accurately describes what cBioPortal contains (cancer genomics data, mutations, gene expression, etc.).",3,"The answer fully addresses the user's question by clearly stating it cannot be answered with the available source, explaining why, and suggesting appropriate alternative resources for this type of inquiry.",2,"While the core message is clear, the response includes somewhat verbose explanations about what cBioPortal does contain and multiple alternative resources, making it longer than necessary for the simple 'out of scope' determination.",3,"The output correctly relies on understanding the limitations of the cBioPortal database as the context/source and does not attempt to answer the medical question using external knowledge, staying faithful to the constraint that only cBioPortal data should be used."
Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,1,"The LLM output makes specific claims about library preparation protocols (e.g., 'TCGA studies use ribosomal RNA depletion rather than polyA enrichment') without having access to this information in the cBioPortal database. The expected answer clearly states that library preparation protocols are not contained in the database.",1,"The LLM completely fails to address the actual scope of the cBioPortal database. Instead of acknowledging that library preparation information is not available in the database and directing users to consult publications, it provides detailed claims about specific protocols.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing extensive lists of studies and detailed recommendations when the correct answer should simply state that this information is not available in the database.",1,"The LLM output contains significant hallucinations. It claims knowledge about library preparation protocols that are not present in the cBioPortal database, directly contradicting the expected answer which states these protocols are not contained in the database and should be consulted in publications."
In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?,2,"The LLM output provides 5 down-regulated genes (AGR3, SRARP, TBC1D9, ABCC8, CT62) but only 2 out of 5 match the expected answer (AGR3, SRARP). The expected genes TFF1, CYP2B7P, and CPB1 are missing, while TBC1D9, ABCC8, and CT62 appear instead. This suggests the analysis methodology or filtering criteria may differ from the expected results.",3,"The output fully addresses the question by providing exactly 5 down-regulated genes as requested, along with comprehensive statistical details including expression differences, sample sizes, and gene annotations. The analysis methodology is clearly explained.",1,"The output is excessively verbose, providing extensive details about each gene including Entrez IDs, gene types, detailed statistical measures, and lengthy explanations that go well beyond what was asked. A simple list of the top 5 genes would have sufficed.",3,"The output is entirely based on database queries from cBioPortal as specified in the context. All information is traceable to the SQL queries executed against the database, with no external knowledge or hallucinations introduced."
