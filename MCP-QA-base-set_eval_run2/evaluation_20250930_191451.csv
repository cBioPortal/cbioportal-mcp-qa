How many studies are in cBioPortal?,5,"The output correctly states there are 492 studies in cBioPortal, which matches the expected answer exactly.",5,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the specific number of studies and briefly explaining what these studies contain.,4,"The core answer is concise and direct. The additional explanation about what the studies contain is brief and relevant, though not strictly necessary to answer the question.",5,The answer is based solely on the SQL query result from the cBioPortal database as specified in the context. The additional information about the studies containing genomic and clinical data is a reasonable inference from the database context without introducing external knowledge.
How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,5,"The LLM output provides the exact correct numbers: 24,950 patients and 25,040 samples, which perfectly match the expected answer.",5,The answer fully addresses the question by providing both the patient count and sample count for the MSK-CHORD Study as requested.,3,"While the core answer is clear and prominent, the output includes additional details about the study description, publication, and licensing that weren't requested and make the response less concise than necessary.",5,"The numerical answers are derived from the cBioPortal database queries shown, and the additional study details appear to be from the same database source. All information is traceable to the specified context source."
How many primary samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?,5,"The output correctly states there are 15,928 primary samples in the MSK-CHORD Study, which exactly matches the expected answer of 15928 primary samples.",5,The answer fully addresses the question by providing the specific count of primary samples and identifying the correct study (msk_chord_2024).,4,"The main answer is direct and concise, but includes some additional context about other sample types that, while informative, is not strictly necessary to answer the specific question asked.",5,"The answer is based solely on database queries executed against the cbioportal database as specified in the context. The SQL queries show the systematic approach to finding the information, and no external knowledge was used."
What is treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?,5,"The LLM correctly identifies Fluorouracil as the most common treatment, which matches the expected answer. The supporting statistics (6,319 patients, 26.3%) appear to be derived from the database queries.",5,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying the most common treatment and provides comprehensive supporting data including patient counts, percentages, and context about combination therapies.",3,"While the core answer is clear, the response includes extensive additional information (top 10 treatments, study overview, combination therapy notes) that goes beyond what was asked. The question only asked for the most common treatment.",5,"The answer is entirely based on the database queries shown, with all statistics and findings traceable to the SQL results from the cbioportal database context provided."
What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,5,"The LLM output provides highly accurate information that closely matches the expected answer. All 5 genes (TP53, MUC16, TTN, ATRX, DNAH9) are correctly identified, and the frequencies are nearly identical to the expected values with only minor rounding differences (22.7% vs 22.4% for TP53, 11.3% vs 11.2% for MUC16/TTN, 7.8% vs 7.7% for ATRX, 7.1% vs 7.0% for DNAH9).",5,"The output fully addresses the question by providing all 5 most frequently mutated genes with their mutation frequencies, sample counts, and percentages. It includes additional context about the study size (141 samples) and biological significance.",3,"While the core answer is well-structured with a clear table, the output includes somewhat verbose additional context about TP53's biological significance and osteosarcoma patterns that, while informative, goes beyond what was strictly asked for.",4,"The output is largely faithful to the database source, as evidenced by the SQL queries that retrieve mutation data from the cbioportal database. However, the statement about 'TP53 mutations are recognized as one of the most common genetic alterations in this cancer type' and the comment about consistency with 'known osteosarcoma biology' appear to draw on external knowledge rather than the database query results."
What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?,5,"The output correctly states that 11.6% of patients were older than 5 years when diagnosed, which matches the expected answer of 11.62% (the small difference is due to rounding).",5,"The answer fully addresses the question by providing the exact fraction (11.6%) and additional context including the raw numbers (125 out of 1,076 patients) and complementary statistics.",3,"While the core answer is direct, the output includes extensive additional context (age range, mean, median, epidemiological commentary) that goes beyond what was asked. The question only requested the fraction, but the response provides much more detail than necessary.",4,"The statistical data (11.6%, 125/1,076 patients, age ranges, mean/median) is derived from the database queries shown. However, the final paragraph about neuroblastoma epidemiology ('consistent with the known epidemiology of this cancer type') appears to draw on external medical knowledge rather than the database results."
What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?,2,"The LLM correctly identifies R175H as the most frequent mutation, but provides incorrect frequency data. The expected answer shows 5.95% of samples, but the LLM reports 21 occurrences without proper percentage calculation or context about total sample size.",5,The answer fully addresses the question by identifying the most frequent mutation (R175H) and provides comprehensive additional context including other frequent mutations and overall statistics.,2,"The output is excessively verbose, providing a top 10 list of mutations, extensive context, and detailed methodology when the question only asked for the most frequent mutation. Much of this information is unnecessary for answering the specific question.",4,"The answer is primarily based on database queries shown in the output, but includes some interpretive context about the biological significance of the R175H mutation that may draw on external knowledge rather than purely from the cbioportal database results."
How many patients have an EGFR amplification in the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study?,4,"The LLM output provides accurate data from multiple TCGA lung adenocarcinoma studies. The TCGA PanCancer Atlas result (26 patients, 4.5%) closely matches the expected answer (26 patients, 4.6%), with only a minor difference in percentage calculation that could be due to rounding or slight dataset variations.",5,"The output fully addresses the question by providing comprehensive data across multiple TCGA lung adenocarcinoma studies. It goes beyond the basic requirement by showing results from four different TCGA datasets, giving context about the variation between studies.",3,"While the core answer is clear, the output is somewhat verbose by including results from multiple studies when the question asks about 'the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma study' (singular). The additional context and explanations, while informative, make the response less concise than necessary.",5,"The output relies entirely on data queried from the cBioPortal database as specified in the context. All information appears to be derived from the SQL queries executed against the database, with no external knowledge or hallucinations evident."
Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?,5,"The LLM output correctly identifies the most common KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer. The top mutations listed (G12D, G12V, G13D, G12C, G12S, G12A) match the expected answer, with accurate frequency data and percentages derived from the cBioPortal database analysis.",5,"The answer fully addresses the question by not only listing the most common KRAS mutations but also providing comprehensive statistics including frequency counts, percentages, codon distribution, and overall mutation rates. All mutations from the expected answer are covered.",2,"While the core answer is correct, the output is excessively verbose. The question asks simply which mutations are most common, but the response includes extensive additional details like codon distributions, statistical breakdowns, and background information that, while accurate, are not necessary to answer the basic question.",5,"The output relies entirely on data from the cBioPortal database as specified in the context. All statistics, mutation frequencies, and rankings are derived from the SQL queries executed against the database, with no external knowledge or hallucinations introduced."
What is the median survival time in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?,5,"The LLM output correctly identifies the median survival time as 21.02 months, which closely matches the expected answer of approximately 22 months. The slight difference is likely due to the specific dataset queried and is within reasonable bounds.",5,"The output fully addresses the question by providing the median survival time and goes beyond by including additional statistical measures (quartiles, min/max), sample size information, and important contextual notes about data limitations.",3,"While the core answer is provided clearly, the output includes extensive additional details that weren't specifically requested, such as quartile statistics, data breakdown by survival status, and literature context. Although informative, this makes the response quite lengthy for a straightforward statistical question.",4,"The output is largely faithful to the database queries and results shown. However, it includes some external knowledge, such as the statement about '5-year survival rates are typically reported around 60-70% for patients without metastatic disease' from published literature, which wasn't derived from the cBioPortal database queries."
How does methylation of the MGMT gene promoter affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with glioblastoma?,5,"The LLM output correctly states that MGMT promoter methylation leads to better prognosis and improved response to temozolomide treatment. The data presented shows methylated patients having longer survival (16.0 vs 11.9 months) and lower mortality rates, which aligns with established medical knowledge.",5,"The output comprehensively addresses both aspects of the question - prognosis (survival outcomes) and treatment response (specifically to temozolomide). It provides detailed statistics, discusses molecular context with IDH status, and explains clinical implications for both prognostic and predictive value.",3,"While the information is valuable, the output is quite lengthy and includes extensive statistical details that, while relevant, make it somewhat verbose. The core answer could be conveyed more concisely while still being informative.",5,"The entire response is based on data queried from the cBioPortal database as specified in the context. All statistics, survival data, and conclusions are derived from the SQL queries executed against the database, with no external knowledge or hallucinations present."
For patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancer how do the different fusion variants affect their long-term quality of life and risk of developing a secondary cancer?,5,The LLM correctly identifies that the cBioPortal database does not contain quality of life measurements or secondary cancer risk data. The answer accurately describes the limitations of the database and what data is actually available.,5,"The output fully addresses the question by clearly explaining that the specific information requested (quality of life and secondary cancer risk) cannot be obtained from cBioPortal, while providing comprehensive details about what EML4-ALK data is actually available in the database.",3,"While the answer is thorough and informative, it is quite lengthy and includes extensive details about available data types and alternative research approaches that, while helpful, make the response less concise than optimal for answering the core question.",5,The answer is entirely based on the cBioPortal database exploration as evidenced by the SQL queries. The LLM appropriately limits its response to what can be determined from the database and clearly states the limitations without introducing external knowledge.
For the TCGA pan-cancer cohort what is the survival difference and the corresponding statistical significance between patients with mutations in both TP53 and KRAS versus patients with only a KRAS mutation?,2,"The LLM output contains significant factual errors when compared to the expected answer. The expected answer states that patients with both mutations had ~22 months median survival while KRAS-only patients had median survival 'not reached', but the LLM reports 19.33 months vs 21.16 months respectively - showing the opposite survival advantage. The expected p-value of 0.0209 is also missing from the LLM output.",3,"The LLM output addresses the survival difference component but fails to provide the statistical significance (p-value) that was specifically requested. While it acknowledges the limitation of not being able to perform statistical tests, the question explicitly asked for 'corresponding statistical significance' which should have been retrievable from the database.",2,"The output is excessively verbose with unnecessary tables, detailed breakdowns by cancer type, and extensive methodology explanations. A concise answer should focus on the key survival metrics and statistical significance as provided in the expected answer.",4,"The LLM output appears to be based on database queries and analysis, though the specific survival values differ significantly from the expected answer. The methodology and approach seem consistent with database analysis, but there may be issues with data interpretation or query execution that led to different results."
Does Tylenol cause cancer?,5,The LLM correctly identifies that this question cannot be answered using the cBioPortal database and accurately describes what the database contains and what it doesn't contain.,5,"The output fully addresses the user's question by clearly explaining why it cannot be answered with the available data source, and provides appropriate guidance on where such information might be found.",3,"While the core message is clear, the response includes excessive formatting, metadata, and somewhat repetitive explanations that could be more streamlined. The essential message could be conveyed more briefly.",5,The response appropriately stays within the bounds of what the cBioPortal database can provide and doesn't attempt to answer the medical question using outside knowledge. It correctly identifies the limitations of the data source.
Are there studies that were not processed using polyA enrichment in order to explore lncRNA-related questions?,1,"The LLM output claims to have found specific studies using capture methods and provides detailed breakdowns by consortium, but the expected answer clearly states that library preparation protocols are not contained in the database. The LLM appears to have misinterpreted generic database field names as actual methodology information.",2,"While the LLM attempts to provide a comprehensive answer about studies using non-polyA enrichment methods, it fails to address the core issue that this information is not actually available in the cBioPortal database and should be sought from the underlying publications.",1,"The output is extremely verbose and detailed, providing extensive lists and breakdowns of supposedly relevant studies when the correct answer should simply state that this information is not available in the database.",0,The LLM output directly contradicts the expected answer and appears to have hallucinated specific information about library preparation methods that are not actually contained in the cBioPortal database. The presence of terms like 'capture' in database field names does not necessarily indicate the actual RNA sequencing methodology used.
In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA study what are the top 5 down-regulated genes in TP53 mutated samples compared to non-mutated ones?,2,"The LLM output provides 5 genes (AGR3, SRARP, TBC1D9, ABCC8, CT62) but only 2 out of 5 match the expected answer (AGR3, TFF1, SRARP, CYP2B7P, CPB1). AGR3 and SRARP are correct, but TBC1D9, ABCC8, and CT62 are incorrect, missing TFF1, CYP2B7P, and CPB1.",5,"The output fully addresses the question by providing exactly 5 down-regulated genes as requested, along with expression differences, sample sizes, and analytical context.",3,"While the core answer is present, the output includes extensive additional details like z-scores, sample counts, and methodology that, while potentially useful, make the response longer than necessary for the specific question asked.",5,"The answer is based entirely on database queries from cBioPortal as specified in the context. All information is traceable to the SQL queries executed against the database, with no external knowledge or hallucinations introduced."
