# Question 4

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What is treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD Study (MSK, Nature 2024) treatment data, here are the findings:

## Treatment Analysis for MSK-CHORD Study

**Study Overview:**
- Total patients in study: 24,950
- Patients with treatment data: 24,028 (96.3%)

**Most Common Treatment Agents:**

The top 10 treatments received by patients in the MSK-CHORD study were:

1. **FLUOROURACIL** - 6,319 patients (26.3% of patients with treatment data)
2. **LEUCOVORIN** - 5,573 patients (23.2%)
3. **OXALIPLATIN** - 5,489 patients (22.8%)
4. **CAPECITABINE** - 4,808 patients (20.0%)
5. **CARBOPLATIN** - 4,604 patients (19.2%)
6. **IRINOTECAN** - 4,329 patients (18.0%)
7. **INVESTIGATIONAL** - 4,114 patients (17.1%)
8. **GEMCITABINE** - 4,038 patients (16.8%)
9. **LEUPROLIDE** - 3,708 patients (15.4%)
10. **PACLITAXEL** - 3,679 patients (15.3%)

**Answer:** The most common treatment received by patients in the MSK-CHORD Study was **FLUOROURACIL** (5-FU), a chemotherapy agent used to treat various cancer types. It was administered to 6,319 patients, representing about 26.3% of patients with treatment data in the study.

It's worth noting that many patients received combination therapies, as evidenced by the high numbers for complementary agents like LEUCOVORIN (often given with fluorouracil) and OXALIPLATIN (commonly part of combination regimens like FOLFOX).
