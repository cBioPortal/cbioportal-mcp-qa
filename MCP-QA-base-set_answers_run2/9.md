# Question 9

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the cBioPortal database, here are the most common KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer:

## Most Common KRAS Mutations in Colorectal Cancer

### Top Individual Mutations:
1. **G12D** - 2,698 samples (29.3% of KRAS-mutated samples)
2. **G12V** - 1,856 samples (20.1%)  
3. **G13D** - 1,653 samples (17.9%)
4. **G12C** - 653 samples (7.1%)
5. **A146T** - 583 samples (6.3%)
6. **G12S** - 422 samples (4.6%)
7. **G12A** - 408 samples (4.4%)
8. **Q61H** - 193 samples (2.1%)

### Distribution by Codon:
- **Codon 12**: 6,150 mutations (65.0%) - Most common hotspot
- **Codon 13**: 1,750 mutations (18.5%) - Second most common
- **Codon 146**: 714 mutations (7.6%)
- **Codon 61**: 392 mutations (4.2%)
- **Codon 117**: 121 mutations (1.3%)
- **Other codons**: 330 mutations (3.5%)

### Key Statistics:
- **Total colorectal cancer samples analyzed**: 28,453
- **Samples with KRAS mutations**: 9,223 
- **KRAS mutation rate**: ~32.4% in colorectal cancer
- **Data spans**: 34 different studies

### Summary:
The most common KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer are:
1. **G12D, G12V, and G13D** account for ~67% of all KRAS mutations
2. **Codon 12 mutations** are the dominant hotspot (65% of mutations)
3. The **G12D substitution** is the single most frequent KRAS mutation
4. All top mutations are **missense mutations** affecting critical regulatory codons

This pattern is consistent with known oncogenic KRAS mutations that disrupt GTP hydrolysis, leading to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways in colorectal carcinogenesis.
