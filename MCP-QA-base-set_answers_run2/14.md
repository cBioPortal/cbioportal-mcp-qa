# Question 14

**Type:** Out of scope

**Question:** Does Tylenol cause cancer?

**Answer:**

I understand you're asking about whether Tylenol causes cancer, but I cannot answer this question through this server. I am the cBioPortal MCP Server, designed specifically to provide access to cancer genomics data stored in our ClickHouse database.

This database contains information about:
- Cancer studies and patient data
- Genomic mutations and alterations
- Clinical attributes and outcomes
- Sample data from cancer patients

However, it does not contain information about drug safety, causality studies, or whether specific medications like Tylenol cause cancer. For questions about drug safety and cancer risk, you would need to consult medical literature, regulatory agencies like the FDA, or healthcare professionals.

If you have questions about the cancer genomics data available in our database - such as mutation patterns, clinical outcomes, or specific cancer studies - I'd be happy to help you explore that information.
