# Question 5

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes**:

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Samples with Mutations | Mutation Frequency |
|------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 1    | **TP53**    | 32                     | 22.7% (32/141)   |
| 2    | **TTN**     | 16                     | 11.3% (16/141)   |
| 2    | **MUC16**   | 16                     | 11.3% (16/141)   |
| 4    | **ATRX**    | 11                     | 7.8% (11/141)    |
| 5    | **DNAH9**   | 10                     | 7.1% (10/141)    |

**Key findings:**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in nearly 23% of osteosarcoma samples
- **TTN** and **MUC16** are tied for second place, each mutated in about 11% of samples
- The study includes 141 samples with mutation data
- **TP53** mutations are particularly significant as this gene is a well-known tumor suppressor critical in cancer development

This pattern is consistent with known osteosarcoma biology, where TP53 mutations are recognized as one of the most common genetic alterations in this cancer type.
