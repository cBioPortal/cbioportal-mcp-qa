# Question 6

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** What fraction of patients were older than five when diagnosed according to the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the Pediatric Neuroblastoma study from TARGET (study ID: nbl_target_2018_pub), here are the findings regarding age at diagnosis:

**Answer: 11.6% (125 out of 1,076 patients) were older than 5 years when diagnosed.**

**Additional Context:**
- **Total patients with age data:** 1,076
- **Patients older than 5 years:** 125 (11.6%)
- **Patients 5 years or younger:** 951 (88.4%)
- **Age range:** 0 to 21 years
- **Mean age at diagnosis:** 3.4 years
- **Median age at diagnosis:** 3.0 years

This data confirms that neuroblastoma is predominantly a pediatric cancer affecting very young children, with the vast majority (88.4%) of patients being diagnosed at age 5 or younger, consistent with the known epidemiology of this cancer type.
