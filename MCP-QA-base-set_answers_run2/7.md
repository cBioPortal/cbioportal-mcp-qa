# Question 7

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What is the most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene in the TCGA breast cancer study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TCGA PanCancer Atlas breast cancer study (brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018), here are the key findings:

## Most Frequent TP53 Mutations in TCGA Breast Cancer

**The most frequent mutation in the TP53 gene is R175H (missense mutation) with 21 occurrences.**

### Top 10 Most Frequent TP53 Mutations:

1. **R175H** (Missense) - 21 cases
2. **R273H** (Missense) - 13 cases  
3. **R196*** (Nonsense) - 8 cases
4. **Y220C** (Missense) - 7 cases
5. **R342*** (Nonsense) - 7 cases
6. **R213*** (Nonsense) - 7 cases
7. **H193R** (Missense) - 6 cases
8. **H179R** (Missense) - 6 cases
9. **X225_splice** (Splice Site) - 5 cases
10. **I195T** (Missense) - 5 cases

### Context:
- **Total TP53 mutations**: 353 mutations across 347 samples
- **Mutation frequency**: ~32% of samples (347/1080) have TP53 mutations
- **Mutation types**: Predominantly missense mutations, with some nonsense mutations and splice site variants

The R175H mutation is a well-known hotspot mutation in TP53 that occurs in the DNA-binding domain and is associated with loss of p53 tumor suppressor function. This finding aligns with known TP53 mutation patterns in breast cancer from the literature.
