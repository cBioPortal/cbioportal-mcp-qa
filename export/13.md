# Question 13

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the most common metastatic sites for colorectal cancer?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the cBioPortal MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset containing 5,637 colorectal cancer patients, here are the **most common metastatic sites for colorectal cancer**:

## Top Metastatic Sites (by frequency):

1. **Liver** - 7.24-7.69% of patients
   - Most common distant metastatic site
   - Combined liver involvement: ~15% when including both general liver metastases and specific liver site documentation

2. **Lung** - 6.78-1.22% of patients  
   - Second most common distant metastatic site
   - Combined lung involvement: ~8% total

3. **Lymph Nodes** - 8.63% of patients
   - Regional and distant lymph node involvement
   - Often represents locoregional progression

4. **Bone** - 2.79% of patients
   - Less common but significant metastatic site

5. **Reproductive Organs** - 2.78% of patients
   - Includes ovarian metastases (Krukenberg tumors)

6. **CNS/Brain** - 1.16% of patients
   - Relatively uncommon but serious metastatic site

7. **Peritoneum** - 0.31% of patients
   - Peritoneal carcinomatosis, though this may be underrepresented in the data

8. **Adrenal Glands** - 1.0% of patients

9. **Pleura** - 0.98% of patients

## Key Clinical Insights:

- **Liver metastases** are by far the most common, reflecting the portal circulation pattern from colorectal primaries
- **Lung metastases** are the second most common distant site
- **Lymph node involvement** is frequent and represents both regional and distant spread
- The relatively low percentage of peritoneal metastases in this dataset may reflect selection bias toward patients with resectable/targetable disease suitable for genomic profiling

This pattern aligns with the known clinical behavior of colorectal cancer, where liver metastases predominate due to portal venous drainage, followed by pulmonary metastases through systemic circulation.
