# Question 13

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the most common metastatic sites for colorectal cancer?

**Answer:**

Based on the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset analysis of colorectal cancer patients, here are the **most common metastatic sites** for colorectal cancer:

## Top Metastatic Sites for Colorectal Cancer

**Among 1,445 colorectal cancer patients with documented metastatic sites:**

1. **Liver** - 805 patients (55.7%) - *Most common site*
2. **Lung** - 182 patients (12.6%) 
3. **Lymph Node** - 91 patients (6.3%)
4. **Peritoneum** - 56 patients (3.9%)
5. **Ovary** - 39 patients (2.7%)
6. **Soft Tissue** - 38 patients (2.6%)
7. **Omentum** - 36 patients (2.5%)
8. **Brain** - 23 patients (1.6%)
9. **Retroperitoneum** - 15 patients (1.0%)
10. **Abdomen** - 13 patients (0.9%)

## Key Findings:

- **Liver metastasis** is by far the most common, affecting more than half of patients with metastatic disease
- **Lung** is the second most common site, affecting about 1 in 8 patients
- **Peritoneal involvement** (peritoneum, omentum) is relatively common, reflecting the tendency for colorectal cancer to spread within the abdominal cavity
- The pattern shows the classic hematogenous spread to liver and lungs, plus regional spread to peritoneal surfaces
- Less common sites include brain, bone, and various abdominal/pelvic organs

This data represents 1,445 patients with documented metastatic sites out of 5,543 total colorectal cancer patients in the dataset, providing a comprehensive view of metastatic patterns in this patient population.
