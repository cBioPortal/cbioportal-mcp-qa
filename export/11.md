# Question 11

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** Which mutations are most commonly found in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma samples?

**Answer:**

Based on the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the most commonly mutated genes in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma samples:

## Top 20 Most Commonly Mutated Genes:

1. **TP53** - 1,476 samples (1,506 total mutations)
2. **PIK3CA** - 1,163 samples (1,302 total mutations)
3. **GATA3** - 561 samples (578 total mutations)
4. **MAP3K1** - 251 samples (373 total mutations)
5. **KMT2C** - 243 samples (268 total mutations)
6. **PTEN** - 222 samples (238 total mutations)
7. **ARID1A** - 173 samples (190 total mutations)
8. **ESR1** - 166 samples (179 total mutations)
9. **AKT1** - 148 samples (151 total mutations)
10. **CBFB** - 140 samples (140 total mutations)
11. **NF1** - 123 samples (134 total mutations)
12. **MAP2K4** - 123 samples (124 total mutations)
13. **FOXA1** - 118 samples (143 total mutations)
14. **TBX3** - 113 samples (122 total mutations)
15. **RB1** - 109 samples (112 total mutations)
16. **SPEN** - 105 samples (130 total mutations)
17. **NCOR1** - 103 samples (112 total mutations)
18. **KMT2D** - 102 samples (117 total mutations)
19. **FAT1** - 100 samples (112 total mutations)
20. **RUNX1** - 93 samples (102 total mutations)

## Key Observations:

- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in nearly 1,500 samples
- **PIK3CA** is the second most common, present in over 1,100 samples
- **GATA3** rounds out the top three with mutations in over 500 samples

These results align with known biology of breast cancer, where TP53 (tumor suppressor) and PIK3CA (PI3K pathway) mutations are well-established drivers, and GATA3 is a key transcription factor in luminal breast cancers.
