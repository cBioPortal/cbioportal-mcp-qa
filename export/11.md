# Question 11

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** Which mutations are most commonly found in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma samples?

**Answer:**

## Most Common Mutations in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Samples

Based on the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the most commonly mutated genes in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma samples:

### Top 10 Most Frequently Mutated Genes:

1. **TP53** - 1,506 mutations in 1,476 samples (6.79% of samples)
2. **PIK3CA** - 1,302 mutations in 1,163 samples (5.35% of samples)
3. **GATA3** - 578 mutations in 561 samples (2.58% of samples)
4. **MAP3K1** - 373 mutations in 251 samples (1.15% of samples)
5. **KMT2C** - 268 mutations in 243 samples (1.12% of samples)
6. **PTEN** - 238 mutations in 222 samples (1.02% of samples)
7. **ARID1A** - 190 mutations in 173 samples (0.80% of samples)
8. **ESR1** - 179 mutations in 166 samples (0.76% of samples)
9. **AKT1** - 151 mutations in 148 samples (0.68% of samples)
10. **CBFB** - 140 mutations in 140 samples (0.64% of samples)

### Key Observations:

- **TP53** is by far the most commonly mutated gene, found in nearly 7% of Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma samples
- **PIK3CA** is the second most common, present in about 5% of samples
- **GATA3**, a transcription factor important in breast development, is mutated in approximately 2.6% of samples
- The analysis included 21,732 total Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma samples

These results align with known biology of breast cancer, where TP53 and PIK3CA are well-established drivers, and GATA3 is known to be frequently mutated in hormone receptor-positive breast cancers.
