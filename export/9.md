# Question 9

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the most frequently mutated genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Here are the most frequently mutated genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples from the MSK-CHORD dataset:

## Top 20 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in NSCLC

**Total NSCLC samples analyzed: 7,809**

| Gene | Mutated Samples | Frequency |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **TP53** | 4,005 | **51.29%** |
| **KRAS** | 2,183 | **27.95%** |
| **EGFR** | 1,890 | **24.20%** |
| **KEAP1** | 1,033 | **13.23%** |
| **STK11** | 1,013 | **12.97%** |
| **RBM10** | 786 | **10.07%** |
| **PTPRD** | 640 | **8.20%** |
| **KMT2D** | 621 | **7.95%** |
| **NF1** | 600 | **7.68%** |
| **SMARCA4** | 578 | **7.40%** |
| **FAT1** | 552 | **7.07%** |
| **CDKN2A** | 543 | **6.95%** |
| **ATM** | 540 | **6.92%** |
| **PTPRT** | 538 | **6.89%** |
| **ARID1A** | 526 | **6.74%** |
| **KMT2C** | 452 | **5.79%** |
| **PIK3CA** | 443 | **5.67%** |
| **EPHA5** | 442 | **5.66%** |
| **EPHA3** | 423 | **5.42%** |
| **RB1** | 402 | **5.15%** |

## Key Findings:

1. **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in over half (51.29%) of NSCLC samples
2. **KRAS** and **EGFR** are the next most common, representing major oncogenic drivers in NSCLC
3. The top 3 genes (TP53, KRAS, EGFR) are well-known key drivers in lung cancer biology
4. Several tumor suppressor genes appear in the top results (TP53, STK11, NF1, CDKN2A, RB1)
5. Chromatin remodeling genes (KEAP1, SMARCA4, ARID1A) are also commonly mutated

This data reflects the complex genomic landscape of NSCLC, with TP53 mutations being the most prevalent across this large cohort of 7,809 samples.
