# Question 22

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** Do metastatic sites vary based on cancer type?

**Answer:**

Based on this comprehensive analysis of the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, **yes, metastatic sites do vary significantly based on cancer type**. Here are the key findings:

## Major Patterns by Cancer Type:

### **Pancreatic Cancer** - Highly Liver-Specific
- **Liver dominance**: 69% of metastases go to the liver
- **Pattern**: Highly concentrated pattern with liver being the overwhelming target
- Other sites: Lung (5.8%), Peritoneum (5.6%), Lymph nodes (4.8%)

### **Colorectal Cancer** - Strong Liver Preference
- **Liver dominance**: 56% of metastases go to the liver
- **Pattern**: Strong hepatic tropism but more distributed than pancreatic
- Other sites: Lung (12.7%), Lymph nodes (6.3%), Peritoneum (3.8%)

### **Prostate Cancer** - Lymph Nodes and Bone
- **Dual pattern**: Lymph nodes (31%) and bone (26%) are primary targets
- **Pattern**: Reflects prostate cancer's tendency for lymphatic spread and osteoblastic bone metastases
- Other sites: Liver (8.7%), Lung (6.5%), Pelvis (3.6%)

### **Breast Cancer** - Most Diverse Pattern
- **Liver**: 22% - moderate preference
- **Bone**: 18% - reflects breast cancer's osteotropism
- **Pattern**: Most distributed metastatic pattern among all cancer types
- Other sites: Lymph nodes (14.6%), Lung (7.5%), Skin (5.1%)

### **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** - Lymphatic and Pleural
- **Lymph nodes**: 29% (including "Lymph node" variants ~37% total)
- **Pleural involvement**: 11% - unique to lung cancer
- **Pattern**: Reflects local-regional spread pattern
- Other sites: Liver (8.8%), Bone (8.6%), Brain (significant at 8.6%)

## Key Biological Insights:

1. **Organ-Specific Tropism**: Pancreatic and colorectal cancers show strong liver tropism due to portal circulation
2. **Bone Tropism**: Breast and prostate cancers frequently metastasize to bone
3. **Lymphatic Spread**: Prostate and lung cancers show high lymph node involvement
4. **Unique Patterns**: Lung cancer's pleural involvement and breast cancer's skin metastases reflect organ-specific spread patterns

This data confirms that metastatic patterns are not random but follow predictable, cancer type-specific routes that reflect the primary tumor's biology, circulation patterns, and tissue affinities.
