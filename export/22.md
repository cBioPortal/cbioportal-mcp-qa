# Question 22

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** Do metastatic sites vary based on cancer type?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, **yes, metastatic sites do vary significantly based on cancer type**. Here are the key findings:

## Major Patterns by Cancer Type:

### **Breast Cancer** (5,368 patients)
- **Top sites**: Liver (10.1%), Bone (8.4%), Lymph Nodes (6.7%)
- Shows strong tropism for liver and bone metastases

### **Colorectal Cancer** (5,543 patients)  
- **Top sites**: Liver (14.5%), Lung (3.3%), Lymph Nodes (1.6%)
- **Liver dominance**: Highest liver metastasis rate among all cancer types
- Unique pattern: Ovarian metastases (0.7%) - rare in other cancers

### **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** (7,809 patients)
- **Top sites**: Lymph Nodes (10.2%), Pleura (3.9%), Liver (3.2%)
- **Unique pattern**: High pleural involvement (3.9%) - specific to lung cancers
- More evenly distributed metastatic pattern

### **Pancreatic Cancer** (3,109 patients)
- **Top sites**: Liver (24.9%), Lung (2.1%), Peritoneum (2.0%) 
- **Highest liver tropism**: Nearly 1 in 4 patients have liver metastases
- Peritoneal involvement reflects local spread patterns

### **Prostate Cancer** (3,211 patients)
- **Top sites**: Lymph Nodes (10.5%), Bone (8.5%), Liver (3.0%)
- Classic pattern of bone and lymph node involvement

## Key Insights:

1. **Liver metastases** vary dramatically: Pancreatic (24.9%) > Colorectal (14.5%) > Breast (10.1%) > Lung (3.2%) > Prostate (3.0%)

2. **Bone metastases** are most common in: Prostate (8.5%) and Breast (8.4%) cancers

3. **Site-specific patterns**: 
   - Pleural metastases almost exclusively in lung cancer
   - Peritoneal spread more common in abdominal cancers (colorectal, pancreatic)
   - Ovarian metastases primarily in colorectal cancer

This demonstrates that cancer biology strongly influences metastatic patterns, which has important implications for staging, surveillance, and treatment planning.
