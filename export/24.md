# Question 24

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** Is there a correlation between smoking history and Pancreatic Cancer?

**Answer:**

## Analysis: Smoking History and Pancreatic Cancer Correlation

Based on the analysis of the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the key findings regarding the correlation between smoking history and pancreatic cancer:

### Key Results:

**Pancreatic Cancer Patients (3,109 total):**
- **Never smokers**: 1,727 patients (55.55%)
- **Former/Current smokers**: 1,276 patients (41.04%)
- **Unknown status**: 106 patients (3.41%)

**Overall Study Population (24,950 total):**
- **Never smokers**: 12,168 patients (48.77%)
- **Former/Current smokers**: 11,684 patients (46.83%)
- **Unknown status**: 1,098 patients (4.40%)

### Important Observations:

1. **Higher proportion of never-smokers in pancreatic cancer**: Pancreatic cancer patients show a higher percentage of never-smokers (55.55%) compared to the overall cancer population (48.77%) - a difference of **+6.78%**.

2. **Lower proportion of smokers in pancreatic cancer**: Conversely, pancreatic cancer patients have a lower percentage of former/current smokers (41.04%) compared to the overall population (46.83%) - a difference of **-5.79%**.

### Clinical Interpretation:

This data suggests an **inverse correlation** between smoking and pancreatic cancer in this dataset, which is somewhat **counterintuitive** given that smoking is a well-established risk factor for pancreatic cancer in epidemiological studies.

**Possible explanations for this unexpected finding:**
1. **Selection bias**: This is a clinical dataset from a cancer center, not a population-based study
2. **Survival bias**: Smoking may affect survival, potentially leading to underrepresentation of smokers in clinical cohorts
3. **Referral patterns**: Different cancer types may have different referral patterns to MSK
4. **Data collection differences**: Smoking history collection may vary across different cancer types

**Important caveat**: This analysis shows correlation within a clinical cancer cohort, not causation or population-level risk. The established epidemiological evidence still shows smoking as a significant risk factor for pancreatic cancer development.
