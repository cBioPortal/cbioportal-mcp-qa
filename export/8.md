# Question 8

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What kind of data in the MSK-CHORD study reflects MSI/MMR status, and how is it represented?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD study data, here's what I found regarding MSI/MMR status:

## MSI/MMR Data in MSK-CHORD Study

The MSK-CHORD study contains **three main clinical attributes** that reflect MSI/MMR status, all sourced from MPath:

### 1. **MSI_TYPE** (Primary Classification)
- **Purpose**: Main categorical classification of MSI status
- **Values and Distribution**:
  - **"Stable"**: 21,096 samples (~84%) - Microsatellite stable (MSS)
  - **"Instable"**: 699 samples (~3%) - Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)
  - **"Indeterminate"**: 865 samples (~3%) - Uncertain MSI status
  - **"Do not report"**: 1,825 samples (~7%) - Results not reportable
  - **"Do Not Report"**: 1 sample (variant spelling)
  - **Empty/Missing**: 554 samples (~2%)

### 2. **MSI_SCORE** (Quantitative Measure)
- **Purpose**: Continuous numerical score measuring MSI level
- **Range**: 0 to >50 (with some values reaching 53+)
- **Distribution**:
  - **Low scores (0-1.0)**: Most samples cluster here, indicating MSS
  - **High scores (>10)**: Rare, typically indicating MSI-H
  - **Special values**: 
    - "0": 5,711 samples (likely MSS)
    - "-1": 92 samples (possibly QC failures)
    - Empty: 553 samples

### 3. **MSI_COMMENT** (Detailed Interpretation)
- **Purpose**: Human-readable clinical interpretation with additional context
- **Main Categories**:
  - **"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS)"**: 17,040+ samples
  - **"MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY-HIGH (MSI-H)"**: 591+ samples
  - **"MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY-INDETERMINATE"**: 688+ samples
  - **Technical notes**: Often includes "See MSI note below" or "for investigational use only"

## Key Characteristics:

1. **Sample-level attributes**: All three are sample-level (not patient-level) attributes
2. **High coverage**: Present in ~95% of samples in the study
3. **Consistent classification**: MSI_TYPE appears to be the most reliable for categorical analysis
4. **Clinical context**: Comments provide additional clinical interpretation and caveats
5. **Source**: All data comes from MPath, indicating standardized clinical testing

## For Analysis:
- **Use MSI_TYPE for categorical analysis** (MSS vs MSI-H vs Indeterminate)
- **Use MSI_SCORE for quantitative analysis** when continuous values are needed
- **Use MSI_COMMENT for detailed clinical context** and quality flags

This represents a comprehensive MSI/MMR dataset that would be valuable for studying microsatellite instability across different cancer types in the MSK-CHORD cohort.
