# Question 2

**Type:** Cohort Statistics

**Question:** How many patients and samples are in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Based on the query results, the MSK-CHORD Study contains:

- **24,950 patients**
- **25,040 samples**

This means there are slightly more samples than patients, indicating that some patients have multiple samples collected (which is common in cancer studies where patients may have samples taken at different time points or from different sites).
