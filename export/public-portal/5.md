# Question 5

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

## Top 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in TARGET Osteosarcoma Study

Based on my analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (`os_target_gdc`), here are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes:

| Rank | Gene | # Mutations | # Samples | Profiled Samples | Sample % |
|------|------|-------------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 33 | 32 | 143 | **22.4%** |
| 2 | **MUC16** | 17 | 16 | 143 | **11.2%** |
| 3 | **TTN** | 18 | 16 | 143 | **11.2%** |
| 4 | **ATRX** | 11 | 11 | 143 | **7.7%** |
| 5 | **DNAH9** | 10 | 10 | 143 | **7.0%** |

### Key Findings:

1. **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, with mutations found in 22.4% of profiled samples (32 out of 143 samples)
2. **MUC16** and **TTN** are tied for second place at 11.2% mutation frequency
3. **ATRX** shows mutations in 7.7% of samples, which is notable for osteosarcoma
4. **DNAH9** rounds out the top 5 at 7.0% mutation frequency

### Study Context:
- Total samples in study: 235
- Total patients: 226
- Samples with mutation profiling: 143
- This represents the TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) consortium's osteosarcoma cohort

### Notes on Methodology:
- Frequencies are calculated using gene-specific profiling denominators (143 samples for each gene)
- Only non-UNCALLED mutations are included
- Off-panel mutations are excluded from the frequency calculations
- This follows cBioPortal best practices for accurate mutation frequency analysis

The high frequency of TP53 mutations (22.4%) is consistent with what's known about osteosarcoma biology, where TP53 alterations are among the most common genomic events in this pediatric bone cancer.
