Perfect! Now I can provide you with the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study with accurate frequency calculations.

## Top 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in TARGET Osteosarcoma Study

| Gene | # Mutations | # Samples | Profiled Samples | Sample % |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| TP53 | 33 | 32 | 143 | 22.4% |
| MUC16 | 17 | 16 | 143 | 11.2% |
| TTN | 18 | 16 | 143 | 11.2% |
| ATRX | 11 | 11 | 143 | 7.7% |
| DNAH9 | 10 | 10 | 143 | 7.0% |

### Key Findings:

1. **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, with mutations found in 22.4% of profiled samples (32 out of 143 samples)
2. **MUC16** and **TTN** are tied for the second most frequent, each mutated in 11.2% of samples (16 out of 143)
3. **ATRX** is mutated in 7.7% of samples (11 out of 143)
4. **DNAH9** rounds out the top 5 with mutations in 7.0% of samples (10 out of 143)

The high frequency of TP53 mutations (22.4%) is consistent with osteosarcoma biology, as TP53 is a critical tumor suppressor gene frequently altered in this pediatric bone cancer. The presence of MUC16 and TTN in the top mutated genes likely reflects their large size, making them more prone to acquiring mutations, while ATRX alterations are known to be important in pediatric cancers.
