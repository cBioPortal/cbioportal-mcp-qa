# Question 5

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), here are the **top 5 most frequently mutated genes**:

1. **TP53** - Found mutated in **32 samples** (33 total mutations)
2. **TTN** - Found mutated in **16 samples** (18 total mutations)  
3. **MUC16** - Found mutated in **16 samples** (17 total mutations)
4. **ATRX** - Found mutated in **11 samples** (11 total mutations)
5. **DNAH9** - Found mutated in **10 samples** (10 total mutations)

**Key findings:**
- **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in 32 different samples, which is consistent with its well-known role as a tumor suppressor gene commonly altered in many cancers including osteosarcoma
- **TTN** (titin) and **MUC16** (mucin 16) are tied for second place with mutations in 16 samples each
- **ATRX** (a chromatin remodeling gene) is mutated in 11 samples
- **DNAH9** (dynein axonemal heavy chain 9) rounds out the top 5 with mutations in 10 samples

This analysis used the TARGET Osteosarcoma dataset from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), which contains comprehensive genomic profiling data for pediatric osteosarcoma cases.
