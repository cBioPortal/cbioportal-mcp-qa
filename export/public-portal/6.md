# Question 6

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently copy number altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Here are the **top 5 most frequently copy number altered genes in the TARGET Osteosarcoma study**:

## Top 5 Most Frequently Copy Number Altered Genes in TARGET Osteosarcoma

1. **LINC00901** - 32 samples (39.5% of 81 total samples)
   - All alterations are deep deletions (-2)

2. **RN7SL442P** - 31 samples (38.3% of samples)
   - All alterations are amplifications (+2)

3. **MYO15A** - 30 samples (37.0% of samples)
   - All alterations are amplifications (+2)

4. **NCOR1** - 30 samples (37.0% of samples)
   - All alterations are amplifications (+2)

5. **TBC1D26** - 30 samples (37.0% of samples)
   - Mostly amplifications (29) with 1 deep deletion

### Key Findings:
- The study contains **81 total samples** with copy number alteration data
- **LINC00901** is the most frequently altered gene, showing deep deletions in nearly 40% of samples
- The other top genes (RN7SL442P, MYO15A, NCOR1) primarily show amplifications
- All top 5 genes are altered in approximately 37-40% of the osteosarcoma samples

This data comes from the TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) initiative's Osteosarcoma cohort, which is available through the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC).
