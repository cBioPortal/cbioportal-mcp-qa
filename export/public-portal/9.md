# Question 9

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Perfect! Now I can provide you with the top 5 most frequently mutated genes in the MSK-CHORD study with accurate mutation frequencies:

## Top 5 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in MSK-CHORD Study

| Rank | Gene | # Mutations | # Mutated Samples | Profiled Samples | Sample Frequency (%) |
|------|------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **TP53** | 13,876 | 13,124 | 25,040 | **52.4%** |
| 2 | **KRAS** | 7,231 | 7,128 | 25,040 | **28.5%** |
| 3 | **APC** | 7,187 | 4,777 | 25,040 | **19.1%** |
| 4 | **PIK3CA** | 4,178 | 3,708 | 25,040 | **14.8%** |
| 5 | **EGFR** | 2,556 | 2,159 | 25,040 | **8.6%** |

### Key Insights:

1. **TP53** is by far the most frequently mutated gene, found in over half (52.4%) of all profiled samples
2. **KRAS** is the second most common, mutated in 28.5% of samples
3. **APC** shows an interesting pattern with 7,187 mutation events across 4,777 samples, suggesting multiple mutations per sample in some cases
4. All five genes were profiled across the same 25,040 samples in the study, allowing for direct frequency comparisons
5. These genes represent classic cancer drivers commonly altered across multiple cancer types

This analysis excludes uncalled mutations and focuses on samples that were successfully profiled for each gene, providing the most accurate mutation frequency estimates.
