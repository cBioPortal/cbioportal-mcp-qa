# Question 8

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 frequelntly altered genes in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET for mutations, copy numbers and SVs combined?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), here are the **top 5 most frequently altered genes** combining mutations and copy number alterations:

## Top 5 Frequently Altered Genes in TARGET Osteosarcoma Study:

1. **TP53** - 38/156 samples (24.4%)
   - Mutations: 32 samples
   - Copy number alterations: 6 samples

2. **LINC00901** - 32/156 samples (20.5%)
   - Mutations: 0 samples  
   - Copy number alterations: 32 samples

3. **RN7SL442P** - 31/156 samples (19.9%)
   - Mutations: 0 samples
   - Copy number alterations: 31 samples

4. **MYO15A** - 31/156 samples (19.9%)
   - Mutations: 2 samples
   - Copy number alterations: 30 samples

5. **CSMD3** - 31/156 samples (19.9%)
   - Mutations: 6 samples
   - Copy number alterations: 26 samples

**Key observations:**
- The study contains 156 total samples
- TP53 is the most frequently altered gene, predominantly through mutations (consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor)
- Most other frequently altered genes show primarily copy number alterations rather than mutations
- No structural variant (SV) data was found in this dataset - only mutations and copy number alterations are available
- The alteration frequencies range from ~20-24% of samples

TP53's high mutation rate (20.5% of samples) is particularly notable in osteosarcoma, as TP53 mutations are a hallmark of this cancer type.
