# Question 4

**Type:** Treatment

**Question:** What is treatment did most patients receive in the MSK-CHORD Study?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD study data, here are the most common treatments received by patients:

## Treatment Overview
Out of **24,950 total patients** in the MSK-CHORD study, **19,551 patients (78.4%)** received some form of medical therapy prior to or at MSK.

## Most Common Treatment Categories (by number of patients):
1. **Chemotherapy**: 17,010 patients (68.2% of all patients)
2. **Radiation Therapy**: 12,318 patients (49.4% of all patients)
3. **Hormone Therapy**: 8,379 patients (33.6% of all patients)
4. **Targeted Therapy**: 5,377 patients (21.5% of all patients)
5. **Biologic Therapy**: 4,848 patients (19.4% of all patients)
6. **Investigational Treatments**: 4,114 patients (16.5% of all patients)
7. **Immunotherapy**: 3,341 patients (13.4% of all patients)
8. **Bone Treatment**: 2,134 patients (8.5% of all patients)

## Most Commonly Used Individual Drug Agents:
1. **Fluorouracil (5-FU)**: 6,319 patients
2. **Leucovorin**: 5,573 patients  
3. **Oxaliplatin**: 5,489 patients
4. **Capecitabine**: 4,808 patients
5. **Carboplatin**: 4,604 patients
6. **Irinotecan**: 4,329 patients
7. **Investigational agents**: 4,114 patients
8. **Gemcitabine**: 4,038 patients
9. **Leuprolide**: 3,708 patients
10. **Paclitaxel**: 3,679 patients

## Key Finding:
**Chemotherapy was the most common treatment modality**, received by over two-thirds of patients in the study. The high prevalence of fluoropyrimidine-based regimens (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine) suggests many patients had gastrointestinal cancers, which is consistent with MSK-CHORD being a comprehensive cancer genomics study that includes various cancer types.
