# Question 7

**Type:** Genomic Alteration Frequencies

**Question:** What are the top 5 most frequently altered genes in a structural variant in the Osteosarcoma study from TARGET?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis, I need to inform you that the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc) unfortunately does not contain structural variant data in the cBioPortal database. 

Let me provide you with what I found:

1. **TARGET Osteosarcoma Study Status**: The study "os_target_gdc" (TARGET Osteosarcoma) exists in the database but contains:
   - Copy Number Alterations (CNAs): 99,707 events
   - Point Mutations: 2,626 events
   - **No structural variants**: 0 events

2. **Alternative Analysis**: Since structural variants are not available for the TARGET Osteosarcoma study, I can provide you with the most frequently altered genes in **copy number alterations** (which are a form of structural alteration) as the closest alternative:

Based on my analysis of the TARGET Osteosarcoma study (os_target_gdc), I found that **this study does not contain structural variant data** in the cBioPortal database. 

However, I can provide you with the **top 5 most frequently altered genes in copy number alterations** (which are a type of structural genomic alteration) from this study:

## Top 5 Most Frequently Altered Genes (Copy Number Alterations):

| Rank | Gene Symbol | Entrez Gene ID | Altered Samples | Total Events |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1    | LINC00901   | 100506724      | 32              | 32           |
| 2    | RN7SL442P   | 106481043      | 31              | 31           |
| 3    | ZNF286A-TBC1D26 | 119086082  | 30              | 30           |
| 4    | MIEF2       | 125170         | 30              | 30           |
| 5    | TVP23C      | 201158         | 30              | 30           |

## Study Details:
- **Study**: TARGET Osteosarcoma (TARGET, GDC)
- **Total genomic events**: 102,333
- **Copy number alterations**: 99,707 events  
- **Point mutations**: 2,626 events
- **Structural variants**: 0 events

## Note:
Traditional structural variants (translocations, inversions, complex rearrangements) are not available for this TARGET Osteosarcoma dataset. The analysis above shows copy number alterations, which represent gains and losses of genomic segments and are considered a category of structural genomic changes.

If you specifically need traditional structural variant data (fusions, translocations, etc.), you might want to consider other studies in the database that have this data type, such as MSK-CHORD or other comprehensive genomic profiling studies.
