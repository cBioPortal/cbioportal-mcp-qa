# Question 2

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What does the 'Mutation Count' column represent?

**Answer:**

Based on the clinical attribute metadata and sample data, the **'Mutation Count'** column represents:

## Mutation Count (MUTATION_COUNT)

**Definition**: The total number of mutations detected in each sample.

**Key Details**:
- **Attribute Type**: Sample-level attribute (patient_attribute = 0, meaning it's associated with individual samples rather than patients)
- **Data Type**: Numeric values representing counts
- **Range**: In the MSK-CHORD 2024 study, mutation counts typically range from 1 to higher values (I can see counts up to at least 10+ mutations per sample)

**What it represents**:
This column quantifies the total number of genetic mutations identified in each tumor sample through genomic sequencing. It provides a measure of the overall mutational burden or mutational load in each sample.

**Clinical Significance**:
- Higher mutation counts may indicate:
  - Greater genomic instability
  - Potential response to certain immunotherapies (high tumor mutational burden)
  - More advanced or aggressive disease in some contexts
- Lower mutation counts typically indicate fewer detectable genetic alterations

**Distribution in MSK-CHORD 2024**:
The most common mutation counts in this dataset are 3-6 mutations per sample, with thousands of samples having these counts. This suggests the sequencing panel likely targets a specific set of cancer-relevant genes rather than whole genome sequencing.
