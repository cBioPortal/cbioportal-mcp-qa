# Question 10

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** How often do patients with breast cancer develop liver metastases?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the findings about liver metastases in breast cancer patients:

## Key Results:

**Overall Rate**: Out of 5,368 breast cancer patients in the dataset, 541 patients (10.08%) developed liver metastases.

## Important Context:

1. **Data Completeness**: Only 45.77% of breast cancer patients (2,457 out of 5,368) have metastatic site information recorded in the database.

2. **Among patients with metastatic data**: When considering only patients with recorded metastatic information, liver metastases occurred in 541 out of 2,457 patients, which is approximately 22%.

3. **Liver as a metastatic site**: Among breast cancer patients with recorded metastases, liver was the most common metastatic site (540 patients), followed by bone (452 patients) and lymph nodes (359 patients).

## Clinical Interpretation:

The 10% rate should be interpreted cautiously because:
- This represents documented metastases in a clinical database
- Many patients may not have complete metastatic site documentation
- The true rate among patients who develop metastases is likely higher (around 22% based on available data)
- This is a single-institution dataset and may not represent population-wide rates

In clinical literature, liver metastases in breast cancer typically occur in 15-25% of patients who develop metastatic disease, which aligns with the 22% rate observed among patients with documented metastatic information in this dataset.
