# Question 16

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What is the range of tumor purity observed in metastatic breast cancer samples?

**Answer:**

## Tumor Purity Range in Metastatic Breast Cancer Samples

Based on the MSK-CHORD dataset analysis of 2,410 metastatic breast cancer samples with tumor purity data:

### **Range and Distribution:**
- **Range**: 5% to 95% tumor purity
- **Average**: 42.6% tumor purity
- **Median**: 40% tumor purity

### **Key Percentiles:**
- **25th percentile**: 30% tumor purity
- **50th percentile (median)**: 40% tumor purity  
- **75th percentile**: 60% tumor purity
- **90th percentile**: 70% tumor purity

### **Distribution Pattern:**
The most common tumor purity values observed were:
- **30%**: 428 samples (17.8%)
- **60%**: 354 samples (14.7%) 
- **50%**: 329 samples (13.6%)
- **40%**: 333 samples (13.8%)
- **20%**: 300 samples (12.4%)

### **Key Insights:**
1. **Wide range**: Tumor purity varies dramatically from as low as 5% to as high as 95%
2. **Lower median**: The median (40%) is below the midpoint of the range, indicating more samples have lower tumor purity
3. **Common values**: Most samples cluster around 20-60% tumor purity, with 30% being the single most common value
4. **Few extreme values**: Very high purity (>80%) and very low purity (<20%) samples are relatively rare

This distribution reflects the heterogeneous nature of metastatic breast cancer samples and the varying degrees of stromal contamination encountered in clinical specimens.
