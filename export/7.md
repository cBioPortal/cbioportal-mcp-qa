# Question 7

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the most common mutations in patients with Colon Adenocarcinoma?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of the MSK CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the **most common mutations in patients with Colon Adenocarcinoma**:

## Top 10 Most Frequently Mutated Genes in Colon Adenocarcinoma

| Gene | Samples with Mutation | Mutation Frequency | Total Mutations |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **APC** | 2,508 | 74.82% | 3,981 |
| **TP53** | 2,393 | 71.39% | 2,605 |
| **KRAS** | 1,446 | 43.14% | 1,481 |
| **PIK3CA** | 769 | 22.94% | 908 |
| **FBXW7** | 476 | 14.20% | 563 |
| **TCF7L2** | 475 | 14.17% | 525 |
| **SMAD4** | 473 | 14.11% | 536 |
| **BRAF** | 437 | 13.04% | 463 |
| **ARID1A** | 427 | 12.74% | 573 |
| **SOX9** | 420 | 12.53% | 481 |

## Key Findings:

1. **APC** is by far the most commonly mutated gene, found in nearly 75% of colon adenocarcinoma samples
2. **TP53** is the second most frequent, present in over 71% of cases
3. **KRAS** mutations occur in about 43% of cases
4. The analysis is based on 3,352 colon adenocarcinoma samples from the MSK CHORD 2024 dataset

These results align with well-established knowledge about colon cancer biology, where APC and TP53 are known to be key tumor suppressors frequently mutated in colorectal cancer, and KRAS is a common oncogene mutation in this cancer type.
