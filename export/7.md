# Question 7

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the most common mutations in patients with Colon Adenocarcinoma?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the **most common mutations in patients with Colon Adenocarcinoma** (out of 3,352 total samples):

## Top 20 Most Frequently Mutated Genes:

1. **APC** - 2,508 samples (74.8%)
2. **TP53** - 2,393 samples (71.4%)
3. **KRAS** - 1,446 samples (43.1%)
4. **PIK3CA** - 769 samples (22.9%)
5. **FBXW7** - 476 samples (14.2%)
6. **TCF7L2** - 475 samples (14.2%)
7. **SMAD4** - 473 samples (14.1%)
8. **BRAF** - 437 samples (13.0%)
9. **KMT2D** - 433 samples (12.9%)
10. **ARID1A** - 427 samples (12.7%)

## Key Findings:

- **APC** and **TP53** are by far the most commonly mutated genes, found in approximately 3 out of 4 colon adenocarcinoma patients
- **KRAS** mutations are present in about 4 out of 10 patients
- **PIK3CA** is mutated in nearly 1 in 4 patients
- The remaining genes in the top 10 are mutated in 12-14% of patients

These findings align well with known colon cancer biology, where APC and TP53 mutations are hallmarks of colorectal carcinogenesis, and KRAS mutations are known drivers in a significant subset of colorectal cancers.
