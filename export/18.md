# Question 18

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What is the average mutation count in patients?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the mutation count statistics for patients:

**Average Mutation Count: 8.73 mutations per patient**

Additional statistics:
- **Total patients analyzed:** 23,862
- **Minimum mutation count:** 1 mutation
- **Maximum mutation count:** 696 mutations

This represents the average number of mutations found across all patients in the MSK-CHORD 2024 study who had mutation count data available. The wide range (1-696 mutations) suggests significant variability in mutation burden across different patients and cancer types, which is typical in cancer genomics studies.
