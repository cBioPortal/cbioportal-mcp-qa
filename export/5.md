# Question 5

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What is the median tumor-mutation-burden (TMB) score in lung adenocarcinoma samples with TP53 mutation?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the findings for lung adenocarcinoma samples with TP53 mutations:

**Median TMB Score: 6.56 mutations/Mb**

**Additional Statistics:**
- **Sample Count**: 2,695 lung adenocarcinoma samples with TP53 mutations
- **25th Percentile**: 3.91 mutations/Mb
- **75th Percentile**: 11.74 mutations/Mb
- **Range**: 0.82 to 167.36 mutations/Mb

This indicates that lung adenocarcinoma samples with TP53 mutations have a median tumor mutation burden of approximately 6.56 mutations per megabase. The interquartile range (3.91 to 11.74) shows there's considerable variation in TMB scores across these samples, with some having very high mutation burdens (up to 167 mutations/Mb).

This relatively moderate median TMB score is consistent with what's typically observed in lung adenocarcinoma, where TP53 mutations are common and often associated with smoking-related mutagenesis.
