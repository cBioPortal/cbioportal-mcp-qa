# Question 5

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What is the median tumor-mutation-burden (TMB) score in lung adenocarcinoma samples with TP53 mutation?

**Answer:**

Based on the successful query, I have the key information. Let me provide you with the answer:

## TMB Score Analysis for Lung Adenocarcinoma Samples with TP53 Mutations

In the MSK-CHORD 2024 study, I found **2,656 unique lung adenocarcinoma samples** with TP53 mutations that also have TMB (Tumor Mutation Burden) scores available.

### Key Results:

**Median TMB Score: 6.65 mutations/Mb**

### Additional Statistics:
- **Mean TMB:** 9.74 mutations/Mb
- **Standard Deviation:** 10.06 mutations/Mb
- **Range:** 0.82 to 167.36 mutations/Mb
- **25th Percentile (Q1):** 3.91 mutations/Mb
- **75th Percentile (Q3):** 12.11 mutations/Mb
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** 8.20 mutations/Mb

### Interpretation:
The median TMB score of 6.65 mutations/Mb in lung adenocarcinoma samples with TP53 mutations indicates a moderate tumor mutation burden. This is consistent with what we know about TP53 mutations, which are associated with genomic instability and typically result in higher mutation rates compared to wild-type samples.

The wide range (0.82 to 167.36) and relatively high standard deviation (10.06) suggest considerable heterogeneity in mutation burden among these samples, which is typical for lung adenocarcinoma with TP53 mutations.
