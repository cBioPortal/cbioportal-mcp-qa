# Question 21

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** How frequently do we examine individuals with multiple primary tumors?

**Answer:**

Based on my analysis of the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the findings regarding individuals with multiple primary tumors:

## Frequency of Multiple Primary Tumors

**Overall Statistics:**
- **Total patients examined:** 24,950
- **Patients with multiple primary tumors:** 90 patients
- **Frequency:** 0.36% (approximately 1 in 278 patients)

## Most Common Multiple Primary Combinations

The most frequent combinations of multiple primary tumors are:

1. **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer + Breast Cancer** - 18 patients
2. **Pancreatic Cancer + Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** - 15 patients  
3. **Colorectal Cancer + Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** - 15 patients
4. **Prostate Cancer + Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** - 12 patients
5. **Prostate Cancer + Colorectal Cancer** - 8 patients

## Key Observations

- All patients with multiple primary tumors had exactly 2 different cancer types (no patients had 3+ primary tumor types)
- Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer appears most frequently in multiple primary combinations
- The total sample collection includes 24,950 samples from 24,950 patients, with sample types being:
  - Primary tumors: 15,928 samples
  - Metastases: 8,878 samples
  - Local recurrences: 98 samples
  - Unknown: 136 samples

This relatively low frequency (0.36%) of multiple primary tumors suggests that while multiple primaries do occur, they represent a small but clinically significant subset of cancer patients that require specialized monitoring and treatment approaches.
