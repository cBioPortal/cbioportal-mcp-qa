# Question 12

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** Are PIK3CA mutations more common in primary or metastatic breast tumors?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the findings:

## PIK3CA Mutation Frequency: Primary vs Metastatic Breast Tumors

**Overall Results:**
- **Primary tumors**: 35.61% (1,018 out of 2,859 samples)
- **Metastatic tumors**: 35.43% (873 out of 2,464 samples)

**Key Findings:**

1. **Nearly identical mutation rates**: PIK3CA mutations are present at virtually the same frequency in primary (35.61%) and metastatic (35.43%) breast tumors, with only a 0.18% difference.

2. **Large sample size**: This analysis includes a substantial number of samples (2,859 primary and 2,464 metastatic), providing good statistical power.

3. **Mutation types**: The vast majority of PIK3CA mutations in both primary and metastatic samples are missense mutations:
   - **Primary**: 1,087 missense mutations out of 1,144 total mutations (95.0%)
   - **Metastatic**: 956 missense mutations out of 995 total mutations (96.1%)

4. **Other mutation types**: Both sample types show similar patterns of less common mutation types including in-frame deletions, insertions, and frameshift mutations.

**Conclusion**: PIK3CA mutations are **equally common** in primary and metastatic breast tumors in this dataset, suggesting that PIK3CA alterations are likely early events in breast cancer development that are maintained during metastatic progression rather than being specifically selected for during metastasis.
