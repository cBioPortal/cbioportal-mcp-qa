# Question 12

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** Are PIK3CA mutations more common in primary or metastatic breast tumors?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer samples from the MSK-CHORD 2024 dataset, here are the key findings:

## PIK3CA Mutation Frequencies by Sample Type:

**Primary tumors**: 35.57% (1,017 out of 2,859 samples)
**Metastatic tumors**: 35.39% (872 out of 2,464 samples)
**Local recurrence**: 33.33% (10 out of 30 samples)

## Key Findings:

1. **Nearly identical frequencies**: PIK3CA mutations occur at virtually the same rate in primary (35.57%) and metastatic (35.39%) breast tumors, with only a 0.18 percentage point difference.

2. **No clinically meaningful difference**: The difference between primary and metastatic samples is minimal and likely not statistically significant given the large sample sizes.

3. **Consistent pattern**: Even local recurrences show a similar mutation frequency (33.33%), though the sample size is much smaller (n=30).

## Conclusion:

**PIK3CA mutations are equally common in primary and metastatic breast tumors** in this dataset. The mutation frequency is remarkably consistent across different stages of disease progression, suggesting that PIK3CA mutations are likely early events in breast cancer development that are maintained throughout tumor evolution and metastasis.

This finding is consistent with the biological understanding that PIK3CA is an oncogene involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway, and its mutations often occur early in breast cancer development, persisting as tumors progress and metastasize.
