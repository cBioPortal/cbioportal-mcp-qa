# Question 4

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the different types of 'Sample Type' in the MSK CHORD study, and how many samples (and what percentage) does each type represent?

**Answer:**

Based on the MSK CHORD 2024 study data, here are the different sample types and their distribution:

## Sample Types in MSK CHORD Study

| Sample Type | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Primary** | 15,928 | 63.61% |
| **Metastasis** | 8,878 | 35.46% |
| **Unknown** | 136 | 0.54% |
| **Local Recurrence** | 98 | 0.39% |

**Total samples: 25,040**

## Key Findings:
- **Primary tumors** represent the majority of samples (nearly 2/3 of all samples)
- **Metastatic samples** make up about 1/3 of the dataset
- **Unknown** and **Local Recurrence** samples are relatively rare, each representing less than 1% of the total

This distribution reflects a typical cancer genomics study where primary tumor samples are most commonly collected, followed by metastatic samples, with local recurrences being less frequent due to their clinical rarity.
