# Question 4

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the different types of 'Sample Type' in the MSK CHORD study, and how many samples (and what percentage) does each type represent?

**Answer:**

Based on the MSK CHORD study data, here are the different sample types and their distribution:

## Sample Types in MSK CHORD Study

| Sample Type | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Primary** | 15,928 | 63.61% |
| **Metastasis** | 8,878 | 35.46% |
| **Unknown** | 136 | 0.54% |
| **Local Recurrence** | 98 | 0.39% |

**Total samples: 25,040**

## Key Findings:

1. **Primary tumors** make up the majority of samples (63.61%)
2. **Metastatic samples** represent over one-third of the dataset (35.46%)
3. **Unknown** and **Local Recurrence** samples are relatively rare (<1% each)

This distribution shows that the MSK CHORD study has a good representation of both primary and metastatic samples, which is valuable for studying cancer progression and treatment responses across different disease stages.
