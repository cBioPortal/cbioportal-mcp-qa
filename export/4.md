# Question 4

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the different types of 'Sample Type' in the MSK CHORD study, and how many samples (and what percentage) does each type represent?

**Answer:**

Based on the query results, here are the different sample types in the MSK CHORD study:

## Sample Types in MSK CHORD Study

| Sample Type | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Primary Solid Tumor | 25,040 | 100.0% |

**Summary:**
- The MSK CHORD study contains only one type of sample: **Primary Solid Tumor**
- There are **25,040 samples** in total, all of which are primary solid tumor samples
- This represents **100%** of all samples in the study

This indicates that the MSK CHORD study is focused exclusively on primary solid tumor samples, which makes sense given that CHORD (Homologous Recombination Deficiency) is typically studied in the context of primary tumors to understand DNA repair mechanisms and treatment responses.
