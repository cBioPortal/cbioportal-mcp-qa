# Question 4

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What are the different types of 'Sample Type' in the MSK CHORD study, and how many samples (and what percentage) does each type represent?

**Answer:**

Based on the MSK CHORD study data, here are the different sample types and their distribution:

## Sample Types in MSK CHORD Study

| Sample Type | Sample Count | Percentage |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Primary** | 15,928 | 63.61% |
| **Metastasis** | 8,878 | 35.46% |
| **Unknown** | 136 | 0.54% |
| **Local Recurrence** | 98 | 0.39% |

**Total Samples: 25,040**

## Key Findings:
- **Primary tumors** make up the majority of samples (63.61%), representing nearly two-thirds of all samples
- **Metastatic samples** comprise over one-third of the dataset (35.46%)
- **Unknown** and **Local Recurrence** samples are relatively rare, together accounting for less than 1% of the total
- The dataset has a good representation of both primary and metastatic samples, which is valuable for comparative genomic studies

This distribution reflects the comprehensive nature of the MSK CHORD study, with substantial representation of both primary tumors and their metastatic counterparts.
