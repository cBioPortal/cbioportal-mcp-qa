**Question:** What is the MSK-IMPACT dataset about?

**Answer:**

## About the MSK-IMPACT Dataset (MSK-CHORD)

The **MSK-IMPACT dataset**, specifically the MSK-CHORD study (published in Nature 2024), is a comprehensive cancer genomics dataset from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Here are the key details:

### Overview
- **Full Name**: MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)
- **Scale**: 25,040 tumor samples from 24,950 patients
- **Technology**: Targeted sequencing via MSK-IMPACT platform with matched normal samples
- **Clinical Data**: Extensive clinical annotations, including some derived from natural language processing (NLP)

### What MSK-IMPACT Is About
MSK-IMPACT is a **targeted sequencing panel** designed to detect clinically actionable mutations across hundreds of cancer-related genes. This dataset represents one of the largest real-world cancer genomics cohorts, providing:

1. **Comprehensive Genomic Profiling**: Targeted sequencing of key cancer genes
2. **Clinical Integration**: Real-world clinical data paired with genomic findings
3. **Diverse Cancer Types**: The top cancer types include:
   - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (7,809 patients)
   - Colorectal Cancer (5,543 patients)  
   - Breast Cancer (5,368 patients)
   - Prostate Cancer (3,211 patients)
   - Pancreatic Cancer (3,109 patients)

### Research and Clinical Impact
This dataset is particularly valuable for:
- **Precision Oncology**: Identifying actionable mutations for targeted therapies
- **Biomarker Discovery**: Finding genomic predictors of treatment response
- **Real-World Evidence**: Understanding cancer genomics in clinical practice
- **Comparative Studies**: Large-scale analysis across multiple cancer types

### Data Access
The data is available under the Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0 license for non-commercial use. Commercial users need to contact MSK directly at datarequests@mskcc.org.

This represents one of the most comprehensive real-world cancer genomics datasets available for research, combining the clinical expertise of MSK with cutting-edge genomic sequencing technology.
