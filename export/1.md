# Question 1

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What is the MSK-IMPACT dataset about?

**Answer:**

Based on the data from cBioPortal, here's what the MSK-IMPACT dataset is about:

## MSK-IMPACT Clinical Sequencing Cohort

**MSK-IMPACT** (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) is a comprehensive targeted sequencing platform and dataset from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

### Key Details:
- **Study**: MSK-IMPACT Clinical Sequencing Cohort (MSK, Nat Med 2017)
- **Scale**: 10,336 patients with 10,945 samples
- **Purpose**: Targeted sequencing of 10,000+ clinical cases using the MSK-IMPACT assay

### Data Types Available:
- **Mutation data**: Extended mutation profiles
- **Copy number alterations**: Genomic amplifications and deletions
- **Structural variants**: Chromosomal rearrangements and fusions

### What Makes MSK-IMPACT Significant:
1. **Clinical Integration**: This is real-world clinical sequencing data from cancer patients treated at MSK
2. **Targeted Panel**: Focuses on actionable cancer genes rather than whole genome sequencing
3. **Scale**: One of the largest clinical sequencing cohorts available
4. **Comprehensive**: Includes multiple types of genomic alterations across diverse cancer types

The MSK-IMPACT assay is designed to identify clinically actionable mutations that can inform treatment decisions, making this dataset particularly valuable for precision oncology research and understanding the genomic landscape of cancer in clinical practice.

There are also several related studies in the database that use MSK-IMPACT sequencing for specific cancer types or research questions, showing the broad applicability of this platform.
