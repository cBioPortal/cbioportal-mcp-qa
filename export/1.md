# Question 1

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** What is the MSK-IMPACT dataset about?

**Answer:**

Based on the data from the cBioPortal database, here's what the MSK-IMPACT dataset (MSK-CHORD) is about:

## MSK-IMPACT Dataset (MSK-CHORD)

**Full Name:** MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024)

**Overview:**
The MSK-IMPACT dataset is a comprehensive cancer genomics study that includes:

- **25,040 tumor samples** from **24,950 patients**
- Targeted sequencing performed using MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets)
- Both tumor samples and their matched normal tissue samples
- Extensive clinical annotations, some derived from natural language processing (NLP)

**Key Features:**
- **Targeted Sequencing:** Uses MSK-IMPACT, a targeted sequencing panel that analyzes hundreds of cancer-related genes
- **Clinical Integration:** Rich clinical annotations that provide context for genomic findings
- **NLP-Enhanced:** Some clinical data is enhanced through natural language processing of medical records
- **Large Scale:** One of the largest clinically-annotated cancer genomics datasets

**Data Availability:**
- Available under Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0 license for non-commercial use
- For commercial use, contact datarequests@mskcc.org
- Published in Nature 2024

**Research Applications:**
This dataset is valuable for:
- Cancer genomics research
- Biomarker discovery
- Treatment response studies
- Clinical decision-making tools
- Machine learning applications in oncology

The MSK-IMPACT dataset represents a significant resource for understanding cancer genomics in a clinical context, combining high-quality sequencing data with detailed clinical information from one of the world's leading cancer centers.
