# Question 20

**Type:** Basic/statistical

**Question:** Do male or female patients with Large Cell Lung Carcinoma have a higher average number of mutations?

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis of patients with Large Cell Lung Carcinoma in the MSK-CHORD dataset, here are the findings:

## Results: Mutation Counts by Gender in Large Cell Lung Carcinoma

**Male patients have a higher average number of mutations than female patients:**

- **Male patients (5 patients):**
  - Average mutations: **18.2**
  - Range: 4 to 31 mutations
  - Individual counts: 31, 27, 17, 15, and 4 mutations

- **Female patients (2 patients):**
  - Average mutations: **13.5**
  - Range: 12 to 15 mutations
  - Individual counts: 15 and 12 mutations

## Summary

Male patients with Large Cell Lung Carcinoma have an average of **18.2 mutations** compared to **13.5 mutations** in female patients, representing a difference of 4.7 more mutations on average in males.

**Note:** This analysis is based on a small sample size (5 males, 2 females), so these findings should be interpreted with caution. The difference could be influenced by the limited number of female patients in this specific cancer subtype within the dataset.
